 <h2 id='chI'>CHAPTER I.—CROSSING THE MOUNTAINS IN A MOTOR BOAT.</h2>

<p class='first'>The motor boat <i>Rambler</i> lay at the very summit
of the Rocky Mountains. She was not in a lake,
either, although there were lakes of ice not far away.
She was not in motion, and there was a great silence
all around her.</p>

<p>She lay, propped upright, on a platform car, and
the car, with two broken wheels, stood on a make-shift
spur of track on the right-of-way of the Canadian
Pacific railroad. An unusual place to find a
motor boat. But listen.</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> was <i>en route</i> from the South
Branch, Chicago, to the headwaters of the Columbia
river. She had passed without serious accident
down Lake Michigan, through the Straits of Mackinaw,
through the Sault Ste. Marie river and canal,
and over the crystal waters of old Superior to Port
Arthur, where she had been coaxed to the deck of
the platform car upon which she now stood.</p>

<p>Almost exactly on the boundary line between Alberta
and British Columbia, the flat car had come to
grief, and the trainmen had bunted it to the spur and
gone on about their business, promising to order a
wrecker at the nearest telegraph office. The disabled
car tilted frightfully to the rear as it stood on the
shaky track, giving the platform a twenty-five per
cent. pitch, and causing the <i>Rambler</i> to take on a
rakish air, like a swaggering person with his hat set
on the back of his head.</p>

<p>A few miles to the east was Laggan, sometimes
called Lake Louise, which is 2,368 miles from
Montreal and 5,032 feet above the level of the Pacific
ocean, 500 miles away. About the same distance to
the west was Field, sometimes called Emerald Lake,
2,387 miles from Montreal and over 4,000 feet
above tidewater. The highest altitude on the boundary
at that point is 5,200 feet above the ocean, and
the motor boat was just about there.</p>

<p>It was close to sunset of an April day, and the
mountain pass was cold and desolate. There was
snow on the peaks, and a cold wind blew whistling
through the narrow cut in the gray rock. There
was no living figure in sight from the sidling
platform of the car, or from the foot-square windows
of the <i>Rambler’s</i> tiny cabin. The silence was broken
only by the uneasy wind.</p>

<p>Decidedly it was anything but cheerful outside.
Inside, there was a glowing fire in a small coal
stove, and a shaded electric light brought out the
cozy furnishings of the place. The electric generators
were not working, the motors being silent, but
there was in the accumulators sufficient current for
the light and the little electric stove upon which a
supper was cooking.</p>

<p>Those who have followed the fortunes of the
<i>Rambler</i> to the headwaters of the Amazon will
understand without further detail exactly what kind
of a craft she was. After returning from the
South American expedition, the lads had planned a
trip to the Columbia river, and they were now on
their way to Donald, where the motor boat was to
be launched into the waters of that interesting
stream.</p>

<p>The boys had worked hard in Chicago all through
the winter, and when April came they were ready
for the journey, although their supply of money was
not as large as they had hoped to make it. Of the
five who had visited Cloud island and secured the
store of gold hidden in that semi-volcanic heap of
rocks, however, only three were in shape to set
out on the proposed voyage.</p>

<p>Frank Porter, who owned the gold taken from
Cloud island, had insisted on financing the trip, but
this the self-reliant boys would not listen to,
preferring to depend upon their own exertions. Julian
Shafer, in the interest of whose health the Amazon
trip had originally been planned, had acquired a
little property through the exertions of Dr. Holcomb,
the physician who was treating him for tuberculosis,
and had decided to spend the winter and summer at
Los Angeles.</p>

<p>So, of the five, there remained only Clayton
Emmett, Cornelius Witters, and Alexander Smithwick
to carry out the exploration of the Columbia the
following spring. It was hoped, however, that both
Frank and Julian would be able to join their friends
at some point lower down. The story of the boys’
adventures on the Amazon may be found in the
first volume of this series.</p>

<p>On this night, then, “Clay,” “Case,” and
“Alex,” as they were familiarly called, were
gathered around the coal heater in the cabin of the
<i>Rambler</i>, high up in a rocky pass on a mountain
range, the range forming the backbone of the
continent of North America. There was plenty of coal
on the platform car, and so they had no fear of
passing a chill as well as a desolate night on the great
divide. Also, the boys had plenty of provisions, as
there were numerous boxes on the car which were
to be emptied of their eatables and carried on board
the motor boat whenever the great river was
reached.</p>

<p>The leasing of the car had eaten into the finances
of the boys quite seriously, but they anticipated
living mostly on game and fish during the run down
the Columbia to the Pacific ocean. They had made
no calculations for the return ride to Chicago,
believing that they would be able to find employment at
Portland.</p>

<p>Boy-like, they had figured on the future only
so far as the end of the river journey was concerned.
A motor boat trip down the Columbia was too
fascinating, they declared, to be mixed up with any
prosaic monetary calculations!</p>

<p>“If we go broke,” Case had said, when the closing
details were under discussion, “we can walk back!
I’d rather swim around Cape Horn and walk back
to little old Chicago than miss the days and nights
we are going to have on the Columbia!”</p>

<p>“You’re light headed!” Alex had responded.</p>

<p>“That will be an aid in swimming!” Case had replied.
“Anyway, it is the Columbia first. The future may
take care of itself!”</p>

<p>This night in the mountain pass should have been
spent on the Columbia at or near Donald, but the
boys were by no means discouraged. Case was
inclined to express annoyance and disgust at unfavorable
conditions, but really he was as courageous in
the face of difficulties as either of his companions.
They had been left on the spur early that morning,
and had anticipated relief in the shape of a wrecking
outfit before noon.</p>

<p>While the supper of bacon, beans, pancakes and
coffee sputtered and steamed on the electric stove
and the heater sent out generous waves of warmth,
Clay arose and opened the cabin door, which faced
to the west. The wind immediately chased itself into
the room, played tag with everything movable, and
went whistling cheerily out again.</p>

<p>At a shout of remonstrance from Alex, Clay drew
the door shut and stepped out on the deck of the
<i>Rambler</i>. He stood for a second with the wind
from the Pacific keen on his face, the ruddy light of
the setting sun bright in his eyes, and then beckoned
through the glass panel of the door to the boys inside.
Case was too busy over the pancakes to notice
the signal, but Alex increased Case’s anger by opening
the door again and forcing his body out against
the wind.</p>

<p>The sun dropping lower, the pencils of light which
touched the crags were slipping away, leaving them
indistinct in the gathering night, as if the sunlight
had brought them into existence with a touch and
condemned them to obliteration by withdrawing
itself from their angular sides. The boys stood for a
second in silence, Clay listening.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Alex grinned, catching Clay by the arm
and pointing to the wild country to the west. “This
makes me feel queer! Why, we might be the sons
of Noah, looking out of the Ark after it stranded
on Mt. Ararat! Here we are, in a boat up on the
mountains, and there, below, is the lifeless world! I
wonder,” he continued, nudging Clay in the ribs to
give emphasis to his observation, “if we had a dove,
and the dove should be sent out, whether it would
bring back an engine with a car fitted up to drag
this old hulk to the railroad hospital?”</p>

<p>“No dove would mind bringing a wrecking train back
in his bill!” replied Clay. “Of course not!”</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex insisted, “we’ve got to get help from
some source. Two trains have passed us to-day
without a whisper of help. A steamer on the ocean
wouldn’t pass a wrecked boat like that!”</p>

<p>Clay bent his head and shielded his ears with cupped
palms.</p>

<p>“There’s a train coming now,” he declared.</p>

<p>“That’s the wind!” Alex answered.</p>

<p>“Can’t you hear it pounding, pounding up the grade
to the east?” demanded Clay. “There!” he added, as a
sharp whistle was borne faintly to their ears
against the rush of the wind, “didn’t you hear
that?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Alex replied. “And it isn’t a passenger,
either. A loaded freight, all right. Here’s where we
get out!”</p>

<p>The roaring of the train wheels, the sharp hissing
of the laboring exhaust, the pounding of the
straining drivers, came nearer and nearer, then only
the wind was heard.</p>

<p>“Phantom train!” Alex laughed. “Nothing doing!”</p>

<p>Case came out of the cabin and stood holding the
edge of the door in his hand, his eyes fixed on his
chums.</p>

<p>“Do we get away now?” he asked. “I hear a train
coming.”</p>

<p>“She is stalled on the grade, I guess,” Clay
replied. “Anyway, she isn’t coming any nearer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” Case grumbled, “I suppose we can stay
out here until the railroad gets a new wrecking crew
and a new machine made! Old Rip Van Winkle’s little
mountain stunt was a summer night on a sleeping
porch compared with this. If anybody should come
along in the next hundred years, just wake me up,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Going to bed?” asked Clay, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“You bet he isn’t!” shouted Alex. “He hasn’t had his
supper yet. Catch him going to bed without pancakes
and bacon!”</p>

<p>“And the pancakes are burning, too!” cried Case,
entering the cabin and slamming the door after him.</p>

<p>“Come on, Case,” urged Alex. “Let’s go down the
grade and see what’s the matter, and what sort of a
train it is.”</p>

<p>“We’ll find out soon enough if we remain here,” Clay
answered. “Besides, we ought to be getting things
propped up in the cabin, so there will be a little
furniture left when we get bumped out on the main
track.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll just pry the truck up with a jack, put
in new wheels, and we’ll sail away like a ship on a
summer sea!” Alex grinned. “If you won’t go. I’ll go
alone.”</p>

<p>Before Clay could utter the remonstrance that was on
his lips, the boy was away down the grade to the
east, his cap bobbing along the ties ahead of his
leaping feet, his hair flying in the gale.</p>

<p>Before he was well out of sight around an angle in
the pass the rumble of a heavy train was heard
again, and directly the round, red eye of a
headlight met the ruddy illumination of the sun in
the narrow pass. Clay could see the smutty face of
the engineer peering out of the cab window as the
engine toiled, panting, upward, and then he saw the
fireman looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Both were gazing, with no little wonder showing
on their faces, at the unusual sight of a motor boat
perched on a platform car at the summit of the Rocky
Mountains. Clay stood hopeful for a moment, and then
the train roared toward the grade to the east,
winding down like a snake in the fading light.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chII'>CHAPTER II.—CAPTAIN JOE FOLLOWS A TRAIL.</h2>

<p class='first'>Clay stood dejectedly for a moment, his hands in his
pockets, his eyes following the streamer of smoke
which marked the progress of the inhospitable train.
Then the cabin door opened and a white bulldog with
friendly eyes and a monster of a jaw walked forth in
a dignified manner and sat down to look over the
scenery.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that, Captain Joe?” Clay
asked, patting the dog on the head. “Isn’t that just
about the worst luck in the world? I wish you could
grip that train by the cowcatcher and bring it back
here. It ought to have helped us out.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe, looking in the direction of the column
of smoke, fast disappearing, worked his lips into a
snarl which showed a set of capable teeth. He
evidently agreed with Clay as to the moral character
of the person in charge of the train.</p>

<p>Case opened the cabin door and looked out, waving a
pancake turner in one hand. He smiled when he noted
Clay’s discouraged attitude.</p>

<p>“Fine, eh?” he cried. “If I had in a book all the
things the Canadian Pacific people do not know about
relieving a fellow in distress, I’d have the biggest
volume ever printed!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the people who left us here neglected to
notify division headquarters,” suggested Clay, never
willing to pass censure until all the facts were at
hand. “Anyway, we’re probably here for the night, so
we may as well make the best of it. Supper ready?”</p>

<p>“Hot on the table,” replied Case. “Where’s Alex?”</p>

<p>“He went down the grade, east, and will doubtless be
back in a moment. Flag him with a pancake, and he’ll
come running!”</p>

<p>“Go bring him, Captain Joe,” ordered Case. “Go tell
Alex that the last call for supper is on in the
dining car.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe wiggled his stumpy ears, agitated his
excuse for a tail, and turned a wrinkled nose to
the north. In a moment he started away in that
direction.</p>

<p>“Here!” called Clay, “Alex didn’t go in that
direction! Come here, you foolish dog, that’s not
the right way to go! Come on back here!”</p>

<p>Captain Joe looked back condescendingly, as if he
realized that he was doing business with a very
young person who really did not know what he was
talking about, and, crouching down, uttered a low
threat of a growl.</p>

<p>“There’s something in there,” Case decided, “some
man or some wild animal. Captain Joe doesn’t often
make mistakes. I’ll get a searchlight and take a
look. He may have discovered something good to eat!”</p>

<p>“Be careful,” advised Clay. “It isn’t more than a
hundred feet back to the wall of rock, and whatever
is in there, man or beast, is pretty close to us.
Wait until I get my gun.”</p>

<p>The searchlight revealed nothing save bare rock and
stunted, starved shrubs which grew protestingly in
such shallow soil as had found its way into the
crevices of the rocks.</p>

<p>“You’re a rattle-headed dog, Captain Joe,” Clay
admonished, as the boys turned back toward the
platform car and its cargo of motor boat.</p>

<p>But Captain Joe was not inclined to accept this
reproof lightly. Instead of going back with the
boys, he bounded to a sloping shelf of rock and
uttered a succession of growls, menacing and
deep-chested.</p>

<p>“There <i>is</i> something up there!” Case commented. “It
may be a bear. There are bears in British Columbia,
you know.”</p>

<p>“You are likely to know it, if you go up there,”
Clay laughed. “I advise you to keep away.”</p>

<p>“Do the bears of British Columbia talk?” asked Case,
who was closer to the dog and the shelf of rock than
his companion.</p>

<p>“Yes; with their teeth,” answered Clay.</p>

<p>“Well, this bear, the one up on the rocks, is trying
to coax the dog up to him,” answered Case. “I heard
him tell Captain Joe that he was making a great
mistake in looking upon him as an enemy, or words to
that effect. Captain Joe doesn’t believe him, at
that!”</p>

<p>“You heard a voice up there?” interrogated Clay,
hardly crediting the statement. “I guess you are
having a dream!”</p>

<p>Captain Joe passed out of sight in the dusk and his
hoarse protests died away. Clay called to him to
come back, but the dog did not make his appearance.</p>

<p>“I’m going after him,” Case declared. “He may get
shot. There’s a man in there, all right!”</p>

<p>Clay held his chum back with both hands and called
again and again to the dog. Directly Captain Joe
returned, looking very much like a boy who had been
invited to a delightful excursion and then detained
at home by parental command. He crouched down at
Clay’s feet, but kept his eyes on the rocks above.</p>

<p>“I guess the dog knows,” Case argued. “You can’t
fool Captain Joe. There is some one hiding in the
rocks.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” argued Clay, “we’ve been lying here
since early this morning, haven’t we? Well, that is
only a narrow place, between the spur and the almost
perpendicular wall of rock, and we would have seen
anybody sneaking about, wouldn’t we? Why, I’ve been
up there where the dog went half a dozen times
to-day, and there was no sign of a person there, no
sort of a place for one to hide in. You heard a wild
animal growling, that’s what you heard.”</p>

<p>“I guess I know what I heard!” Case contended.
“Perhaps you’d better tell me I’m stone deaf! I tell
you I heard a human voice, speaking to the dog!”</p>

<p>“If there was any one in hiding it was Alex playing
some of his foolish pranks,” insisted Clay.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” laughed Case. “The dog wouldn’t have gone
to Alex if asked to! Of course not! And Captain Joe
would have made a bristle of his back and growled at
Alex like he did that fellow up there! Of course he
would! You can say what you like, but I’m going to
see what it was Captain Joe growled at. I need a
little exercise, anyway!”</p>

<p>“It is a wonder Alex wouldn’t come back,” Clay
remarked, as Case, armed with a searchlight and an
automatic, started away.</p>

<p>The boy turned back at mention of the absence of his
chum.</p>

<p>“He may be in trouble,” he said. “He may have come
across the man who is hiding up yonder. I’ll look
him up, all right.”</p>

<p>Night had fallen, a dull, windy night, with now and
then a star showing through driving masses of
clouds. There would be a moon later, but now the
spaces below, the canyons and the lifting peaks,
were as thoroughly out of sight as if the sun had lugged
them off with him across the wide stretches
of the Pacific ocean!</p>

<p>“You stay here and watch the boat,” Clay urged, in a
moment, “and I’ll take Captain Joe and go down the
track. The dog will follow the trail Alex left, and
we’ll soon know where the boy is.”</p>

<p>Case grumbled not a little at this arrangement, for
it was his nature to be in the thick of any ruction
within sound of his ears, but he finally consented
to remain with the motor boat and entered the cabin.</p>

<p>“I’ll make a light lunch of a couple of dozen
pancakes,” he called from the doorway, as Clay and
Captain Joe passed out of sight in the darkness.</p>

<p>Alone in the little room, the boy trimmed the fire,
put on more coal, removed a scorched pan of cakes
from the electric stove, and then sat down to listen
and wait. He was by far too anxious and excited to
partake of the feast he had prepared for all three.</p>

<p>The wind lifted directly and howled more dismally
around the boat, tearing at the window sash and
rattling the door as if with human hands. Then Case
turned off the electric light, switched out the
cooking fire, drew a chair covered with a coat in
front of the coal stove, so that the live coals and
the flames might not show through the crevices about
the openings, and sat silent and, if the exact truth
must be told, not a little afraid.</p>

<p>The boy would have bravely faced almost any peril
that came to him openly and in the light of day, but
this sitting alone, in the darkness, with the wind
storming like mad through the pass, more than five
thousand feet above tidewater, was a little too
much. He wanted action. He found himself unable to
sit there alone and wait. Clay and Alex seemed to be
away a long time.</p>

<p>Finally he armed himself again and went out, softly
closing the door behind him in order that any
lurking person might not know that he was abroad. He
shivered a moment in the cold wind and then crouched
down under one of the windows.</p>

<p>Once he thought he heard a call from the east, but
the wind hissed in his ears so insistently that he
could not be sure that it was a human voice he
heard. He strained his eyes down the pass in the
hope of seeing Clay’s electric torch, but the
darkness was not broken.</p>

<p>“They might at least give me a signal!” he mused.</p>

<p>But no signal came, and the lonely boy huddled
closer to the side of the motor boat and waited and
listened. According to the schedule made out in
Chicago, he should now be on the deck of a floating
boat, instead of on the deck of a craft stuck up
like a house on wheels on the planks of a platform
car.</p>

<p>Instead of sitting there in the wind at the very
summit of the Rocky mountains, he should have been
viewing the never-failing panorama of the Columbia
river, somewhere below Donald, fifty or more miles
to the west. Besides being lonely, there was in the
heart of the boy a feeling of apprehension which he
could not shake off.</p>

<p>There surely must be something wrong down the pass,
he believed. Captain Joe would follow the tracks
left by Alex and Clay would follow the dog. This
should have brought the searcher to some disclosure
long before. He had decided to leave the boat and
follow on down the trail when a sound at the side of
the car attracted his attention.</p>

<p>It seemed to the listener that some one was climbing
up on the platform, moving stealthily, still
clumsily enough to be heard above the rush of the
wind. The boy sat perfectly still, ready with his
electric flashlight and his automatic revolver.</p>

<p>The intruder, whoever it was, came nearer, and Case
knew that he had now reached the floor of the
car and was moving toward the motor boat. Even if the
lad’s position had enabled him to view the slow
progress of the intruder, which it did not, he could
not have followed his movements with his eyes
because of the darkness.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but wait until the skulker
came under the prow lamp of the boat. Then, by the
turning of a switch from the corner of the cabin
structure, the boy could throw a glaring light over
the whole car as well as the deck of the motor boat.
Thus revealed, and dazed by the sudden illumination,
the prowling man might easily be seen and brought to
terms.</p>

<p>Mixed with a sense of danger in the heart of the boy
was a feeling of anger at the impudence of the
fellow, and with both emotions was merged a
curiosity to know what the chap’s motive could be,
how he came to be there, and what could be his
object in hiding instead of approaching openly. The
footsteps moved forward over the planks of the car
and a trembling motion ran through the timbers of
the boat as a weight tipped it a trifle to one side
in mounting to the deck.</p>

<p>Off to the east Case thought he caught a glimmer of
light——not a white strong light, such as would
come from an electric torch, but a dull, reddish glow,
such as would be likely to come from the hot coals
of a campfire. As he looked, the glow grew, as if
the coals, stirred by the wind had burst into a
brisker flame.</p>

<p>Then the boy heard the intruder approaching the door
of the cabin, his approach louder and more confident
because of the darkness and silence inside, and,
reaching out, turned on the great electric light at
the prow.</p>

 <h2 id='chIII'>CHAPTER III.—ALEX FINDS USE FOR HIS KODAK.</h2>

<p class='first'>When the long freight train dashed by Alex without
slowing down, he stood for an instant frowning and
shaking his clenched fist at the rear brakeman, who
swung his lantern in derision and passed into the
caboose.</p>

<p>“Nice thing!” muttered the boy. “Now we’ve got to
stop here all night! Whee! Case will have a fit, all
right! If this hard luck keeps up, he’ll get so he
can have two fits at a time! That will be fine!”</p>

<p>Alex was about to turn to the track again and walk
back to the flat car when the thought came to him
that the conductor might have misunderstood orders
regarding the exact location of the sidetracked car
and stopped at the wrong place. Railroad men often
did things like that, he reasoned!</p>

<p>“He stopped, all right,” the boy muttered, “for
there wasn’t a hint of the rumbling of wheels in the
air for full five minutes. Now, if he didn’t stop to
pick us up, what did he stop for? I’ll go and find
out!”</p>

<p>It was a problem which, to the inquisitive mind of
the lad, required an immediate solution, so he faced
east again and plodded along the track in the
gathering night. A short distance away he came to a
spot where tracks showed that the train had halted.</p>

<p>It was in a narrow canyon between two towering
peaks, and, just off the south rail, lay a great
rock. Around it were the footprints, and also the
deep indentations of a crowbar, which had evidently
been used by the trainmen in prying the boulder off
the steel highway.</p>

<p>“They came pretty near stopping here all night!”
Alex mused, looking over the ground. “That rock
certainly would have stopped them <i>good</i>, and,
at that, some of the crew might have been taken
away on a car door!”</p>

<p>There was no doubt that a terrible wreck would have
taken place had the train struck the obstruction
while running at full speed. But, because of the
steep grade and the heavy train, the momentum had
not been great, and the watchful engineer had seen
the rock in time to prevent trouble.</p>

<p>“I wonder how that rock got on the track, in the
first place?” the boy muttered. “Doesn’t seem as if
it could have fallen from that summit. If it had, it
would have been broken into bits.”</p>

<p>“I just believe some one put it there,” was the
conclusion, as he examined the ground. “I reckon
some rough neck wanted to tip the train off the
track!”</p>

<p>This conclusion, hastily formed though it was, led
to other insistent questions. If the boulder had
indeed been placed on the track by human hands,
where were the ruffians who had done it? Had they
hidden in some of the cars, or “on the rods,” and
gone on with the train? Were they still in that
vicinity?</p>

<p>“I think I’d better be getting back to the boat,”
the boy muttered, a vision of bandits and train
robbers peering out at him from the rocks presenting
itself. “If there are any Jessie James persons about
here, we boys would better keep together.”</p>

<p>Alex gave a parting poke at the great rock and
turned around to look over the country to north and
south. There was little to see. On each side of the
tracks loomed a wall of rock. But, a short distance
to the east, the right-of-way curved off to the
south, following a ledge of rock which led downward.
Straight ahead there was a dip, the earth falling
away from the tracks and exposing a vista of wild
canyons and rugged and forbidding crags.</p>

<p>As the lad turned he saw a red gleam in the canyon
straight ahead. It was not the glow of the sunset.
It was too late for that. Besides, the canyon was
considerably lower than the floor of the pass, so
the latest rays of the sun would not have reached it
at all. The landscape darkened as he looked, and
directly he saw leaping flames and figures passing
to and fro in front of the blaze.</p>

<p>“That accounts for the obstruction on the track, all
right!” Alex decided. “I guess we’ve gotten into a
nest of thieves!”</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t tell them what you’re thinking
about!”</p>

<p>Alex turned quickly about, not at first recognizing
the voice, then a white body launched against his
breast, nearly bringing him to the earth.</p>

<p>“Down, Captain Joe!” he exclaimed. “Do you want to
tip a fellow off his feet?”</p>

<p>Then he looked up at Clay with a grin.</p>

<p>“I thought you were a train robber!” he said.
“Wonder you wouldn’t scare a fellow to death!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come up to supper?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Huh!” replied the lad. “Never you mind supper! Just
come along with me and see what I have found!”</p>

<p>“Gold?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Train robbers.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be finding red lions next!” laughed Clay.
“Come on back to the boat. I left Case alone, of
course, to come after you, and there’s some one
prowling around.”</p>

<p>Alex emitted a low whistle.</p>

<p>“That’s one of my train robbers, then,” he said.
“I’ve got a trained band of ’em over in the next
canyon.”</p>

<p>The boy pointed to the smouldering glow straight to
the east.</p>

<p>“Hunters, probably,” Clay suggested.</p>

<p>“Hunters, of course,” Alex replied, “but they’re
hunting something besides wild animals.”</p>

<p>“If I had your imagination, I’d be writing fiction
for the magazines,” Clay answered. “Why do you call
them train robbers?”</p>

<p>“Because they tried to throw that freight from the
track—the freight that just passed. The trainmen had
to roll a rock off the track. That’s what the stop
was for.”</p>

<p>It was now Clay’s turn to express amazement by a low
whistle.</p>

<p>“But why should they want to throw a freight off the
track?” he asked in a moment. “There’s nothing
nourishing in the looting of a freight. Suppose we
go over and see who they are?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Alex replied, “I’ll go if you think best,
but I’ll tell you this first. That freight was
running on the time of a passenger. See? Oh, they’re
train robbers, all right, and if there is any one
prowling around the boat it is one of the bunch. You
may be sure of that!”</p>

<p>Captain Joe now moved away from the boys and
approached the lip of the canyon, where he paused
and expressed disapproval of the men outlined
against the fire by a series of savage growls.</p>

<p>“Come away, Captain Joe!” ordered Clay.</p>

<p>The dog growled again, but drew away from the
canyon.</p>

<p>“We can’t take him along with us,” Alex declared.
“He would give us dead away. We’ve got to slip up to
the fire and find out what is doing without making
our presence known.”</p>

<p>“That seems to be the proper way,” admitted Clay.</p>

<p>“Go back home. Captain Joe!” ordered Alex in a
whisper.</p>

<p>The dog understood and replied by a wag of a
sawed-off tail that he would go if the boys thought
it best that he should, but that he wished it
understood that he did so under protest.</p>

<p>“Go back to Case!” ordered Clay.</p>

<p>Captain Joe gave one reluctant growl with his face
to the canyon and started away.</p>

<p>“He feels just like I used to feel when the big boys
sent me out of a ball game at Lincoln park,” Clay
laughed. “He thinks there is something going on here
that he ought to be in with.”</p>

<p>When the dog disappeared from view the boys turned
to the canyon.</p>

<p>“There’s a ridge we can follow,” Clay said,
pointing, “and it will bring us out some distance to
the right of the fire, with a lift of rock between
us and our mysterious friends. Be careful, though,
for it is getting darker every minute.”</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t dark,” Alex grunted, “we wouldn’t be
going into the canyon at all.”</p>

<p>The boys made their way as silently as possible down
the “hogsback,” but, with all their caution, a
dislodged stone now and then thundered from under
their feet to the bottom of the canyon. However, the
wind was still blowing a gale, and they hoped that
this would drown the noise of their advance.</p>

<p>It took them a long time to get down to the level of
the campfire, which now supplied all the light they
had to guide them. There were a few stars visible,
but a low-lying mass of clouds was scudding
overhead, and these shut out what little light came
from above except at rare intervals.</p>

<p>“This doesn’t look much like a day on the Columbia!”
Alex declared, blowing warm breath on his
half-frozen fingers. “Huh! It is cold enough here to
freeze the ears off a brass cat!”</p>

<p>“If the <i>Rambler</i> could talk,” Clay said, falling
into the mood of his chum, “she’d be saying things
about being taken on a cruise to the top of the
Rocky Mountains. Look out, now! The ledge turns
here, and straight ahead is a drop of a thousand
feet, I guess, from the time it takes to bring the
sound of a rolling stone back to us.”</p>

<p>The adventurous lads turned with the ledge, crawling
now on hands and feet and keeping close to a ridge
which formed the summit of the long crag. Presently
they came to a rock which blocked their way.</p>

<p>The campfire was just beyond the rock, so they did
not attempt to pass around the obstruction. They
nestled down in the shelter of the boulder for a
time and listened, but the wind was so strong that
it carried any words which might have been spoken at
the fire off to the east.</p>

<p>In moving about Clay bumped his face against a hard
substance under Alex’s coat.</p>

<p>“Say,” he asked, rubbing his nose, “what kind of an
infernal machine have you got under there? Are you
trying to carry away a piece of the mountain? Or
just blow it up? You nearly broke my face.”</p>

<p>Alex clapped his hand to his side and Clay could
feel him chuckling, his body shaking with suppressed
mirth.</p>

<p>“I’ve got the big idea!” Alex said, then. “That’s my
dandy kodak you bunted into! Had it with me, taking
pictures, to-day, and forgot to leave it in our
luxurious private car. Lucky, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any luck in it for me,” grumbled Clay,
still nursing his nose. “Why don’t you keep out of
the way when you go about armed like that?”</p>

<p>Alex chuckled again and moved around the angle of
the rock, toward the fire. Clay seized him by the
foot and held him back, squirming.</p>

<p>“You’ll find out if they are train robbers if you go
fooling around there,” he said. “What fool thing are
you trying to do?”</p>

<p>“Leave go of my foot!” exclaimed Alex kicking like a
mule. “I’m going to get a snapshot for my private
collection.”</p>

<p>“You may get a shot that won’t be much of a snap,”
Clay replied, in better humor. “Can you get by the
angle of the rock far enough to do the trick? I’d
like a copy of that photograph myself.”</p>

<p>“Of course I can,” was the reply. “I can see four
men at the fire now, and they are all set for a good
picture. Wait a minute!” he added. “One of them is
going to throw a lot of brush on the blaze. I’ll
show you a peach of a flashlight effect before
long.”</p>

<p>The boy edged farther along, and Clay heard him
snickering as he brought out the kodak and waited
for the right moment to come. Clay became impatient,
presently, and advanced toward him.</p>

<p>“Get back!” Alex whispered, almost in his ear, as he
pushed against him. “I had eight films in and I’ve
used ’em all. And there’s a giant of a man coming
out this way. Get back! Take a tumble in some hole
in the ground! I guess he saw me!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chIV'>CHAPTER IV.—A NEW FACE ON THE RAMBLER.</h2>

<p class='first'>When the prow lamp of the <i>Rambler</i>, in response to
the turning of the switch by the excited boy, flared
out, Case saw a slender figure standing close to the
cabin door, which was closed. The lad’s first
impulse was to fire at the intruder, but the figure
looked so shrinking, so lacking in aggressiveness,
the face showing under a man’s slouch hat was so
white, so appealing, that he lowered his weapon and
called out:</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>There was no verbal answer, but the boy, for such
the intruder appeared to be, began slowly backing
away, toward the railing of the boat.</p>

<p>“Stand where you are!” ordered Case, presenting his
weapon again. “I want to know something about this.
Look up here!”</p>

<p>The other’s eyes, shrinking and afraid, looked for a
moment into those above the threatening revolver and
then dropped.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” was the next question.
“What are you doing on board the <i>Rambler</i>? Why do
you come sneaking up?”</p>

<p>Case thought he saw a quick start at the mention of
the name of the boat, but still there was no reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on!” Case advised, in a kinder tone,
“you’d better talk. I shall not hurt you. Did you
get off that freight?”</p>

<p>Case had lowered his arm while speaking, and the
intruder took advantage of the fact. He leaped
backward, over the railing, to the floor of the car
and jumped to the ground. It was all done so quickly
that Case had no time to prevent the escape, and
that would doubtless have been the last of the boy,
so far as he was concerned, if a strange and
unexpected element had not intruded into the case.</p>

<p>When Case stepped forward to the railing of the deck
and looked down, he heard a cry of fright and saw a
white figure and a brown one tumbling about on the
ground.</p>

<p>“Let go—let go!” came a voice from out the
entanglement.</p>

<p>This was followed by a snarling growl in which Case
recognized the deep-chested voice of Captain Joe.</p>

<p>“Here!” the boy called out to the dog. “Let up,
Captain Joe! Watch him, old fellow, but don’t eat
him up!”</p>

<p>The dog separated himself from the tangle and sat
up, his wrinkled nose, his twitching ears and
jerking tail, apparently following every movement of
his late antagonist.</p>

<p>“Did he bite you?” asked Case, hastening down to
where the boy lay, not daring to make a move.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” was the pitiful reply. “I think he
tore my clothes, though.”</p>

<p>“Lucky he didn’t tear your throat,” Case commented.
“Get up and come into the cabin. I want to know who
you are, and why you are here. Keep away, Captain
Joe!”</p>

<p>The dog did not seem pleased with the idea of
transferring his prisoner to the custody of another,
but he mounted slowly to the deck of the motor boat
and sat gloomily watching the two until the cabin
door closed against him.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a nice way to thank a fellow!” his
eyes seemed to say, as he turned an ear to the east
in response to the beating of wheels on the upward
grade.</p>

<p>There was another train coming, and Case opened the
cabin door and looked out Captain Joe greeted him
with a dignity which was at once a promise of
forgiveness and a reminder of previous discourteous
treatment.</p>

<p>Case listened an instant and turned his face back
into the cabin.</p>

<p>“I’m going out now,” he said to the captive inside,
“but I’m leaving the dog on guard. He’ll eat you up
if you try to get away.”</p>

<p>With this cheerful remark he turned from the cabin
and listened to the steady roar of the approaching
train.</p>

<p>“If you are hungry,” he called back, already moving
away and leaving the door open so that the watchful
dog might be seen from the interior, “there are cold
pancakes and bacon on the table, and coffee on the
stove. We got supper a long time ago, but this has
been our busy night, so we haven’t eaten yet.”</p>

<p>There was an instantaneous rattling of dishes and
Case smiled as he peered through the open door.
The prisoner was eating as if he had not seen food
before in a long time.</p>

<p>“Go to it!” laughed Case. “You’re welcome. And, say,
if you know anything about electric stoves, you
might warm up that coffee. Or perhaps you can do it
quicker on top of the coal stove, if the fire hasn’t
gone out.”</p>

<p>The headlight of the on-coming train was now in the
pass, lighting the rails until they glistened again,
bringing the platform car and the boat set rakishly
upon it out in bold relief. And just in front of the
engine, running at full speed along the ends of the
ties, was Clay. Alex could be seen clinging to one
of the cab steps with the fireman threatening him
with a shovel of coal.</p>

<p>Much to Case’s delight, the engine drew up in front
of the sidetracked car, and the conductor came
running down from the caboose, swinging a lantern in
his hand. He threw a volley of ugly words at Alex
and stepped up to where Case stood, leaning over the
railing of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Does that kid belong with you?” he demanded,
flinging his lantern out in the direction of Alex.
“He might have been killed, making a catch like
that. Where is the boss of this outfit?”</p>

<p>“We are all bosses,” replied Case, not at all
pleased with the abrupt manners of the conductor.</p>

<p>“Humph! A mess of boys! Well, get a move on, here,
and let us hitch you on. We’ve lost time enough
now.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t lose any more on our account,” Case
replied, provokingly. “Get busy just as soon as you
like. In other words, ‘Fire, Gridley, as soon as you
are ready,’” he added, with a grin, repeating the
words of Dewey at Manila bay.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have the firing of you!” exclaimed the
exasperated conductor. “Here, boys,” he added,
addressing a group of men who came up from the
caboose, “get the jacks under the car and put in two
new wheels. We’ve got to haul her down to Donald.”</p>

<p>There was then a great flashing of lanterns, a
clashing of tongues, and a groaning of steel screws
as the jacks lifted the rear end of the car high in
the air. Clay and Alex dived into the cabin to
straighten out possible entanglements there and were
amazed at coming upon a slender stranger busy at the
pancake griddle. They both stopped in the middle of
the room, which was not a very large one, and looked
the questions they were too breathless to ask.</p>

<p>“I was told to warm up the coffee,” the boy said,
“and I thought I’d cook some more cakes. I’ve eaten
all you cooked for supper, and all the bacon, too. I
was hungry.”</p>

<p>“I should say so,” Alex responded. “There was enough
cakes for six harvest hands.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” the slender boy said, apologetically,
“and I’ll make it right.”</p>

<p>“Forget it!” cried Alex. “It is right now.”</p>

<p>Outside the trainmen were letting the axle, clothed
with new wheels, down on the track, which they did
with a spiteful bump. For an instant all three boys
lost their footing and came together with a dash
which nearly threw them to the floor. The incident
brought them closer together, socially as well as
physically, and they were making friends fast when
the car was hauled out on the main line.</p>

<p>“You’re a new one on me,” Alex was saying when the
conductor gave the signal and the train went
rattling off toward the Pacific ocean.</p>

<p>When the car was well under way Clay and the others
began asking questions of each other and of the
stranger, who seemed nervous and anxious to get
away—eager to leave the boat, yet longing to remain!</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” asked Clay, after the
boys were gathered about the table for the delayed
supper. “Queer thing, your lighting down on us here,
at the summit of the Rocky mountains. Do you belong
to the gang over there by the campfire?”</p>

<p>The lad gave a quick start of surprise and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“When did you get here?” asked Alex. “Was it you
prowling around the car just after sunset?”</p>

<p>The boy nodded, but did not answer the first
question by saying when he had reached that
locality.</p>

<p>“How did you get here?” put in Case. “I don’t think
you’ve walked to the great divide.”</p>

<p>“Why, I came on that train,” was the reply.</p>

<p>The stranger did not say which train, but the boys
took it for granted that he referred to the freight
train which had been held up by the boulder blocking
the way.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you go to the campfire instead of coming
to the boat?” asked Clay, suspiciously. “It was
nearer to the fire, and you must have seen it, for
the train stopped near the ridge that leads to it.”</p>

<p>“I was over there,” replied the boy, hesitatingly,
“but I didn’t like the appearance of things, so I
came on and happened on your car.”</p>

<p>“What is your notion of those men at the fire?”
asked Clay.</p>

<p>“I think they may be outlaws.”</p>

<p>“Just what I think!” Alex shouted. “Clay thinks they
are hunters, but he’s weak-minded sometimes! What
makes you think they are outlaws?” he continued,
determined to have his own impression of the men
sustained by an eye-witness.</p>

<p>“Because I heard some talk about fleeing from
justice.”</p>

<p>“There!” cried Alex nudging Clay. “Now will you be
good? I’m glad we got out of that locality just as
we did, for I believe some one saw me taking a
snapshot and followed us.”</p>

<p>“I think you are dreaming,” Clay laughed, but the
stranger gave a startled glance about and crouched
closer in the corner where he sat.</p>

<p>The boys noted his shrinking attitude and looked at
each other significantly. Just why he should show
terror at the mention of the men in camp was a
matter which they would, they thought, inquire into
later.</p>

<p>“When you get done talking to each other,” Case put
in, sourly, “you might tell me something about the
campfire and the men you took a snapshot at and got
chased for your pains.”</p>

<p>Then Clay told the story and Alex added amusing
frills by telling how Clay had tried to pull him
back by the legs so he couldn’t take the snapshots
he wanted.</p>

<p>“But I got the pictures,” the boy laughed, “just the
same—eight of them. One of the fellows was
continually throwing mountain grass or some other
light stuff on the fire, and it was as good as a
flashlight.”</p>

<p>“Will you let me see the pictures?” asked the
stranger, showing great interest in the recital.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait until I get them in shape,”
Alex laughed. “I don’t propose to take chances by
having them out now. Would you know the men at the
fire if you saw them again?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“What were you doing on the freight train?” asked
Case, abruptly.</p>

<p>“Just stealing a ride,” was the slow, bashful reply.</p>

<p>“You got off here when it stopped?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“It was still in motion when I got off.”</p>

<p>“Where did you come from—where is your home?”</p>

<p>This from Clay, who had been studying the boy’s face
curiously for some moments. “What city did you live
in last?”</p>

<p>“Chicago,” was the hesitating reply.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” asked Case, as Clay turned his
face away with a quiet smile. “Why don’t you open up
and tell us all about yourself?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to tell,” was the grave reply.
“I’m just a boy tramp, I guess. But I’d like to have
you answer a question,” he added, with a flush on
his pale face. “I’d like to know if it was one of
the men from the campfire who followed you, or—or
some one else.”</p>

<p>“Was there some one else in there?” asked Clay. “You
said you went there before you visited the
<i>Rambler</i>. Do you think there were men there whom we
did not see at the fire?”</p>

<p>“I thought there were men near the campfire who did
not belong there,” was the reply. “They looked so
fierce that I was afraid and ran away. I thought,
perhaps, that you might have been followed by one of
the men I saw hanging about there—not by one of the
campers.”</p>

<p>“Another mystery!” laughed Alex. “On the trip to
the Amazon we picked up a mysterious boy, and here,
presto! we have another. But this boy seems to know
what he’s talking about, and the other one didn’t.
At least, he wouldn’t let us know that he did
for a long time. Whew! I’d have climbed up a star beam if
I’d ’a’ known there were two gangs in the rocks.
One was enough for me!”</p>

<p>The conductor now came climbing back over the train
to the platform car, swinging his lantern
spitefully. Clay opened the cabin door and stood
waiting for him to come up, waiting with a sense of
impending trouble.</p>

<p>The conductor leaped lightly to the deck of the boat
from the platform of the car and stood holding his
lantern up on a level with his eyes in order that he
might see better. Clay switched on the prow light
and stood watching him alertly.</p>

<p>Presently the conductor, now reinforced by a husky
brakeman, stepped squarely in front of Clay and
flashed a pair of angry eyes at him.</p>

<p>“Stand out of the way!” he commanded. “I want to
look inside!”</p>

<p>Clay stood stupidly staring for a moment and then
stepped out of the doorway.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chV'>CHAPTER V.—WHAT TOOK PLACE ON THE TRAIN.</h2>

<p class='first'>There was no need for the conductor to hold his
lantern aloft now, so he set it down on the deck and
glared into the cabin. The husky brakeman crowded
close to him, peering into the interior over his
broad shoulder, a cynical smile on his grimy face.</p>

<p>The conductor seemed disappointed at the result of
his inspection of the cabin. He gave a grunt and a
shrug of the shoulders and turned to Clay, who stood
watching him with apprehension in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Where are the others?” he demanded, in an accusing
tone of voice.</p>

<p>“We are all here,” replied Clay, doing his best to
keep control of his temper, for the manner of the
railroad official was insulting.</p>

<p>“Only four?” the surly conductor asked, still
looking suspiciously around. “These four belong on
the boat, do they?”</p>

<p>The strange boy seemed to shiver with cold or fear.
But the door of the cabin was open, and the wind
sweeping over the moving train was cold and
piercing. In a moment the boy turned his face away.</p>

<p>“All belong here—now,” replied Clay, motioning for
Case, who had an angry answer on his lips, to remain
silent. “We all belong.”</p>

<p>“Where are the men who got on at the pass?” was the
next question.</p>

<p>“This boy got on there,” answered Clay. “He needed
rest and food, and we took him in. If any one else
got on the train at the pass they are not in the
boat—have no right here.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” growled the conductor. “This brakeman says
he saw two rough-looking men swing on the train as
it got under way and move back toward the platform
car. Your bill calls for only three passengers to go
with the boat, and I’m not going to have a gang of
toughs loaded onto me. There’s been too many holdups
in this section now.”</p>

<p>“We are going to Donald,” Clay replied, still
keeping control of his rather unruly temper, “and
we’ll pay the boy’s fare to that point, if you think
we ought to. We are not trying to sneak an extra
passenger in on you. The coming of the boy was
accidental, as you have been told.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come here to collect fares,” shouted the
conductor. “I came back here to spot a couple of
bruisers who headed for this car. If I find them
they’ll hit the grit mighty sudden. Understand
that?”</p>

<p>“Go as far as you like,” Clay smiled. “We have no
interest in any men who might have taken your train
at the pass. Shall I pay for the boy’s ride to
Donald?” he added, putting his hand into a pocket.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the money for his fare, but I’ll throw
the others off, just the same,” exclaimed the
conductor. “I believe you know where the others are,
and my advice to you is to point them out to me.”</p>

<p>“Why are you so particular about finding them in
this car?” asked Clay, smoothly, for he knew that
the railroad official could make them no end of
trouble if he saw fit to do so. “Have you looked
through the entire train? Are there no other
hiding-places to look over?”</p>

<p>“There was an obstruction placed on the track at the
pass,” the conductor said, then, in a more
conciliatory tone, “and the men who got on my train
and started back toward this car are the ones
who did it. It is ten to one that they are up to further
mischief.”</p>

<p>“But you were going to throw them off,” suggested
Clay.</p>

<p>“That was a bluff,” admitted the other. “I thought
you might offer to pay their fare, as you did the
boy’s. They will go down in irons if I find them.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Clay rejoined. “Well, I think you are next
to your job, and I’m sorry I can’t help you. I don’t
know why the men you speak of should seek refuge in
this car, but what you say about their starting back
here is probably true. If I see anything of them
I’ll let you know. By the way,” he added, “we have
some fine coffee, piping hot. Wouldn’t you gentlemen
like a cup?”</p>

<p>Case made a sly face at the word “gentlemen,” and
Captain Joe arose from his rug under one of the
shelf-benches and snarled at the heavy shoes of the
trainmen. Alex covered his mouth with one hand to
check an outburst of laughter. The conductor stared
at the boy and kicked at the dog, as if sensing
ridicule, but addressed his conversation to Clay.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” he said, taking in the fragrant odor
of the coffee, “a cup of something hot wouldn’t come
amiss. We are having coffee in the caboose right
soon, but it is a cold night up here.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be welcome,” Clay answered, “and there are
pancakes, too, if you like them. The boys can make
some in a minute.”</p>

<p>The trainmen drank two cups of coffee each and
greedily devoured a dozen pancakes, which Alex
hastened to make. Alex was wishing that the coffee
would scorch their throats!</p>

<p>The meal over, the conductor’s face took on a
friendlier look.</p>

<p>“At Calgary,” he said, “we were ordered to load on
jacks and extra wheels and pick you up here. News of
the breakdown came there by wire just before we
started out. At Laggan there was a message waiting
for us saying that an attempt had been made to wreck
a freight here. The crew had telegraphed from Field,
just west of here.</p>

<p>“Well, I naturally got the idea into my head that
the breakdown here—or back at the pass, rather—was
just a plant, so I was suspicious when I came up. I
was told in the message received at Laggan to keep
my eyes open for the wreckers, and that is why I was
so short with you.”</p>

<p>“You acted just as I should under the
circumstances,” Clay hastened to say, seeing that
the conductor was inclined to be friendly and
wishing to remain in his good graces. “Now, what
shall I pay you for the extra fare to Donald? We
don’t want to beat the road out of a cent.”</p>

<p>“The coffee pays for that,” smiled the conductor.</p>

<p>“Let us know if you find the men who jumped the
train at the pass,” Clay then said. “This boy thinks
there are two groups of men back there, at the pass,
you know, and is inclined, from appearances, to be
afraid of one of them.”</p>

<p>The stranger turned frightened eyes toward Clay for
only an instant and then faced away again. The
conductor saw the look and asked:</p>

<p>“What is this lad’s name, and where does he come
from?”</p>

<p>“Comes from Chicago,” answered Clay. “We haven’t
learned his name as yet. We have been together only
a short time, you know.”</p>

<p>“What is it, boy?” asked the trainman, not at all
unkindly. “We are sometimes asked to look out for
kids who have run away from home to see the world,”
he added, turning to Clay, “and so I’ll
just make a note of this one’s name and address. Likely
looking lad, eh?” he added.</p>

<p>“My name is Granville,” the boy answered, “Chester
W. Granville, and I lived in Chicago, in Peck
court.”</p>

<p>“Humph,” the conductor remarked. “Not a very
aristocratic place.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” responded the boy, turning away again.
“Ever frequent the South Branch?” asked Clay, with a
quiet smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the reply. “I often went over there,
for I like to see ships and tugs and launches moving
about in the water.”</p>

<p>“And motor boats?” asked Clay, with another quiet
smile.</p>

<p>“Of course,” was the reply. “Motor boats best of
all.”</p>

<p>The conductor wrote down the name and address in a
notebook and got to his feet. Alex punched Case in
the ribs and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>“Funny name and address, I don’t think!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” Case whispered back, “but I’ll bet the
lad is all right. Anyway, I’ve heard that a lie is
only a misstatement of fact to a person entitled to
know the truth, and his name and address is no
business of the conductor’s. I think the con. is
just butting in on us to see what he can find out. I
don’t believe there are any such men as he describes
on board—if there are, they never got on at the
pass.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got another mystery with us!” grinned
Alex as the trainmen left, swinging lanterns to
light the way. “A strange maverick of a boy and two
fierce-looking men! We’re getting all there is in
this drama, all right—red fire and all! If the
Columbia river trip makes good with the overland
journey, we’re in for excitement—and then some. Say,
Clay,” he continued, “why did you ask Mr. Chester W.
Granville if he ever visited the South Branch in
Chicago?” with a wink at the boy.</p>

<p>“Why,” Clay answered, “it seemed to me that I had
seen him somewhere before, when I entered the cabin
and found him making pancakes. I had an idea, when
he said that he lived in Chicago, that I might have
seen him there, but the impression is an indistinct
one. It seems to be connected with some other matter
which I cannot now bring to mind.”</p>

<p>“He ought to remember if he ever saw you before,”
suggested Alex.</p>

<p>The boy said nothing, and Case and Clay prepared
their bunks for a short sleep. They would reach
Donald before daylight, and so would have only a
short period of rest. The train was running fast
over a roadbed none too smooth, but that did not for
a second keep them awake.</p>

<p>Alex and Gran, as the new member of the party was
known from that night, sat in the cabin and compared
notes regarding life in Chicago for a short time,
and then Gran fell asleep on his bench and Alex went
to the prow of the <i>Rambler</i>, now bobbing about
under the motion of the train as if it had come back
to its own in some wild river, and looked out on the
swaying coaches ahead. The moon had arisen, and
there was plenty of light at intervals, although the
sky was still flecked with clouds.</p>

<p>Field was soon passed, and then the milder grade
down to the valley of the Columbia river began. The
scene was such as the boy had long hoped some day to
see. The snow-capped peaks, the silver of the
moonlight on the lower crags, the heavy shadows of
the canyons, the long lines of steel binding
together the Atlantic and the Pacific! He had heard
many tales of daring robberies and bloody feud
encounters in that vicinity, and looked upon
every crag and canyon as the possible scene of an outlaw
gathering.</p>

<p>Presently he saw a figure running toward him along
the tops of the box cars. Now it stooped low, as if
fearful of being seen, now it lifted to full height
and leaped from roof to roof. When it came nearer
the boy saw that it was not the conductor or the
brakeman who had visited the cabin some time before.</p>

<p>This was a larger man than either of the trainmen he
had seen. The shoulders were broad, denoting great
physical strength, and the height was not less than
six foot three. Another peculiarity the boy noticed.
The arms were unusually long, even for so tall a
man. As they swayed away from the body with the
motion of the train he saw that the fingers dropped
almost to the knees.</p>

<p>The face the boy could not see distinctly. It was
covered with a great beard and shaded by the brim of
a cowboy hat. Directly another figure, carrying a
lantern, appeared on the top of the train. Alex
heard a shout, and then a pistol shot. The tall man
in advance halted, limped over to the side of the
car, swung down a ladder and disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>The second figure came running up to the car
attached to the one on which the <i>Rambler</i> lay and
shouted across to the boy:</p>

<p>“Where did he go?”</p>

<p>There was much noise and the wind was blowing
against his voice, so Alex could not make the other
understand that the fugitive had gone down the side
ladder except by pointing. The whole scene had
seemed so unreal to the boy that he half expected to
see the tall man bob up in the moonlight from some
dark canyon and continue his frantic flight over the
swaying coaches.</p>

<p>“Guess I got him!” shouted the other, lowering his
lantern. “Here’s blood on the roof. There were two
of them, and both got away.”</p>

<p>Alex remembered the conductor’s story of the men who
had swung on at the pass, and was not altogether
displeased at the thought that they had been chased
off the train. In the tall figure which had swayed
toward him for a time and then almost dropped,
bleeding, from the car top, he thought he had
recognized the figure which had pursued him around
the angle of rock where the pictures had been taken.
Feeling safer, he went to sleep, and when he awoke
the car was being detached from the train at Donald.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVI'>CHAPTER VI.—MOURNING AN EMPTY KODAK.</h2>

<p class='first'>The “private palace car,” as the boys called the
platform car which had carried the <i>Rambler</i> out of
Port Arthur, was being shunted from the train to a
siding near the river bank, and some one was pulling
like mad at Alex’s arm. He sat up, rubbing his eyes,
and struck out at the hand which was annoying him. A
chuckle came from the side of his bunk, and he saw
Case standing there with a most exasperating grin on
his face.</p>

<p>“Get up!” the latter cried. “We’ll be afloat on the
Columbia in less than no time. Say, kiddo, but
you’ve been sleeping some! Get up!”</p>

<p>“Where is the Columbia?” asked Alex hardly awake
yet.</p>

<p>“Why,” laughed Case, “I forgot to take it in last
night and so it froze stiff on the roof. The
boys are thawing it out with a flat iron. Where did you
think it was, silly?”</p>

<p>“You’re all right,” Alex grunted, dressing as fast
as his hands could move, “but you have foolish
spells. Which way is the Columbia from here? I’m in
a hurry to get a look at it. My, but there’s a heap
of fun coming to us now. Good old river, eh, Case?”</p>

<p>“You know it,” replied the other. “Now, wait a
minute,” he added, as Alex made a move toward the
door. “I came in here to talk with you.”</p>

<p>“You near broke my arm,” complained Alex. “What is
it about? Can’t you wait until I get a peek at the
river? What’s the hurry, anyway?”</p>

<p>Case drew the boy down on the edge of the bunk and
held him there a minute until he quit struggling.
Outside the boys were standing at the prow of the
<i>Rambler</i>, watching the car carrying them closer to
the dock, if such a primitive contrivance might be
called a dock, where the motor boat was to be
launched. Glancing out through the glass panel of
the door, Alex saw that Gran, the stranger who had
come to them so strangely the night before, was
standing in a dejected attitude before Clay, who
appeared to be talking earnestly.</p>

<p>“What’s Clay scolding Gran about?” he asked, then.
“Looks like he was giving him a good one. Let me go
out and see about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to talk with you about,” replied
Case. “We want your advice, don’t you see. It is
about the strange boy.”</p>

<p>“You’ve come to the right shop for sound advice!”
laughed Alex. “What is it about the boy that you
want to know? I guess you have seen as much of him
as I have. I rather like the fellow, but he seems to
have something on his mind—something worrying him.”</p>

<p>“There is,” Case went on. “He insists on leaving us
here, and won’t give any reason for doing so. He
says he has a good reason, and that is all he will
say about it.”</p>

<p>“But how is he ever going to get out of this
desolate land?” asked the other. “He can’t very well
ride on the rods clear to the ocean, and he’ll just
about wear his feet out up to his knees if he tries
to walk out of the wilderness. I don’t suppose he’s
got a cent of money. Say, but do you believe the
story he tells about coming to the pass on the train
that came near bunting into the boulder?”</p>

<p>“If he did,” Case replied, “he found some reason,
pretty quickly, to get on a scare about the men in
the camp, or the men back of the camp.”</p>

<p>“He did seem to be scared of his life whenever the
fellows were mentioned,” admitted Alex. “Do you mind
what he asked me? Wanted to know if it was one of
the men from the campfire who chased me when I took
the snapshots, or whether it was someone else?”</p>

<p>“I remember that,” Case answered. “Queer, eh?”</p>

<p>“Now, how did he know about there being someone else
around there?” continued Alex. “He must have made a
pretty thorough inspection of the place, for we saw
no one except the men by the fire. But, say—”</p>

<p>The lad ceased speaking and sat looking at Case in a
puzzled way, as if trying to solve a knotty problem
which had just come into his head. Case noted the
change of attitude and waited for him to go on.</p>

<p>“S-a-a-y,” the boy continued, in a minute, “I saw
every man at the fire quite distinctly, and there
wasn’t one there as tall as the man who came after
me when I had the camera, or the man who went off
the car last night with a bullet in his back, or his
side, or somewhere.”</p>

<p>Case looked at his chum with questions in his eyes.
Then he laughed.</p>

<p>“You’ve been dreaming again!” he said. “Don’t sleep
on your back, kid, and you won’t have such terrible
experiences.”</p>

<p>“Have I?” demanded Alex indignantly. “You just ask
the brakeman what he shot at last night, and then go
and look at the top of the car. Perhaps you can
squeeze blood out of dreams, but I don’t believe
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you tell us about it last night?”
demanded Case.</p>

<p>“Because I was sleepy. I’m telling you about it
now.”</p>

<p>It took only a few words to inform Case as to the
events of the night before. The boy looked perplexed
as he asked:</p>

<p>“Are you sure that was the man who chased you when
you were out with your kodak? Say,” he went on,
without waiting for an answer, “the con. was right
about two men swinging on at the pass, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Sure he was. Yes, and I’m pretty certain that one
was the man who chased me around the rock. I don’t
know why he should have done it. I didn’t
see him until he broke out of the darkness behind
the ledge. Queer thing!”</p>

<p>“Did he see you taking a picture, with the snoot of
the kodak pointing in his direction?” asked Case,
with a smile that provoked Alex.</p>

<p>“Come, now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” the boy exclaimed,
“I suppose you can tell me exactly why he chased me,
and what his thoughts were as he shot his long legs
through the gloom! How do I know what he saw? I
wasn’t taking any picture of him.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” asked the other. “How do you
know that he wasn’t in view of the kodak? Sometimes
you get a picture that you don’t know anything
about. Where are the pictures you took last night?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t taken ’em out yet,” Alex replied. “I’ll
have to wait until I can get a chance to develop
them. There’s no hurry, is there?”</p>

<p>“I would just like to see what the pictures include,
that’s all,” answered Case. “There must be some
reason for these men chasing us up as they appear to
be doing. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>Alex opened his eyes in wonder, evidently regarding
Case as the originator of a puzzle to which he only
could supply a solution.</p>

<p>“Why,” he asked, presently, “you don’t think the two
men got on the train just because we were on it, do
you? To my mind, they got on because they didn’t
like the looks of the ties as a means of
transportation. I guess you’ll find that that’s all
there is to it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case replied, “I don’t know as I’m right,
but it appears to me that there others in the pass
besides the campers, and that they had some reason
for getting hold of you. I’ll just bet you took one
of their pictures, perhaps as he was peering out
from some shelter, when you snapped the others. And
I’ll wager you the washing of a mess of dishes that
they think you did, whether you did or not.”</p>

<p>Alex laughed silently for a moment and then asked:</p>

<p>“Where did you get it? You’re building a mystery
about a tramp chasing a boy who came too near his
lair! Come, let’s go out on the bank and take a look
at the Columbia, our future home for many a bright
day! We’ve been guessing over nothing long enough.”</p>

<p>“Will you let me see the films?” asked Case, still
in dead earnest.</p>

<p>“Sure! Just fish my kodak out of that mess on
the floor and I’ll get ’em out. You can see them well
enough to learn if there really is any face peering
out from some nook behind the fire.”</p>

<p>Case found the kodak presently and brought it to
Alex who took it into his hand and opened it. Case
saw him looking into the opening where the films
ought to be, and then heard a low laugh. He turned
quickly to see Alex tossing the kodak to the bunk.</p>

<p>“Where are the films?” he asked, as Alex sat down
and chuckled.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the use?” the other asked. “What did you
go and take ’em out for? The chances are that you
have ruined the whole lot.”</p>

<p>It was now Case’s turn to express incredulity.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean?” he said, picking up
the kodak.</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon you know, all right,” grinned Alex.</p>

<p>“But what—”</p>

<p>“Give ’em up!” cried Alex. “You’ve gone and taken
the films out of the kodak! Then you come in here
and ask me to let you see ’em! Give ’em up, I say,
or I’ll be doing something rash!”</p>

<p>The boy was laughing, but still he seemed in
earnest. Case sat down on the edge of the bunk and
looked through the kodak.</p>

<p>“Where are they?” asked Alex nudging the other in
the ribs. “The joke is getting stale.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen them,” was the reply. “I hope you
haven’t lost them, for a whole lot might depend on
having them.”</p>

<p>“Honest?” demanded Alex. “Cross your heart?” he
added, with another provoking grin. “You don’t for a
minute think I believe you, do you?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to, for I am telling the truth,” was
the unexpected answer. “I haven’t seen them.”</p>

<p>“Will you call Clay in here?” asked Alex in a
moment. “I want to ask him two questions. Don’t let
Gran come with him.”</p>

<p>Case, understanding what the boy intended doing,
went out to the prow and sent Clay in, remaining
there with the stranger. When Clay entered the cabin
and closed the door he was not a little surprised at
the grave manner in which Alex looked at him.</p>

<p>“Two questions,” Alex said.</p>

<p>“Go on, schoolmaster,” laughed Clay. “I’m sure I
have my lesson.”</p>

<p>“One: Did you take the films from the kodak?”</p>

<p>“I did not,” replied Clay, with a shake of the
head, a frown gathering about his eyes. “I did not. What
about it? Are they gone?”</p>

<p>“Two: Do you think this Chester W. Granville took
them?”</p>

<p>“I do not think him capable of taking anything by
stealth,” was the quick reply. “But what is this
about? Why don’t you answer my question? Have the
films you took at the campfire last evening been
stolen?”</p>

<p>“They’re gone,” was the answer. “It may be a joke,
but they’re gone, all right. You say you didn’t take
’em, and Case says he didn’t, so what is there to
think except—”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Gran took them,” Clay hastened to
say. “I don’t think he is that kind of a boy.
Besides, he has had no opportunity, that I can see.
He couldn’t have taken them in the night without
waking some of us. I’m not a heavy sleeper, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear the pistol shot in the night?” asked
Alex with a suspicion that Clay had slept sounder
than he knew. “Come, now, did you?”</p>

<p>“I did not,” was the quick reply. “What time was
it?”</p>

<p>“And you say that you would have heard the boy
if he had opened the kodak and taken out the films! Well,
they are gone! Either he took them, or some one took
them while walking in his sleep, or some one sneaked
in during the night and stole them.”</p>

<p>“If any outsider had entered the cabin to get them,”
Clay considered, “he wouldn’t have opened the kodak
in there and left it. He would have made off the
minute he got his hands on it, and opened it
somewhere else? Don’t you think that is right?”</p>

<p>“Sure I do,” replied Alex the frown on his face
growing steadily. “Sure I do. Then, that puts it up
to this Chester person, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“But why should he steal them? Tell me that! And
tell me another thing, while your are at it. What
was the shooting in the night?”</p>

<p>Alex again explained, in as few words as possible,
just what had taken place in the night. Clay saw
more in the occurrence than Case had seen and said
so. He was plainly apprehensive of coming trouble.</p>

<p>“I really believe those fellows were following us,”
he said, presently. “And I believe the photographs
have something to do with it. Well, that may supply
us with a little excitement. Have you been out in
the town yet? Something doing all the morning, while
you’ve been sleeping.”</p>

<p>“Got up a short time ago,” replied Alex. “Now, look
here,” he went on, soberly, “if Gran didn’t take the
films, who did? And, say, if he did, he’ll be likely
to duck away from us at the first chance.”</p>

<p>“He has been trying to leave us now,” said Clay. “He
was about to jump off the car when I stopped him. He
says he has no intention of imposing on us longer!
It does look bad! Still, we don’t know why he should
have taken them. Let’s suspend judgment for a time.
What?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I haven’t convicted him yet,” smiled Alex.
“Only I want to get a line of the films. That’s all.
I want ’em. No, Gran would have no object in taking
them unless he was sent here to do that very thing.
S-a-a-y, Clay, suppose he was sent to us for that
very purpose?”</p>

<p>Clay laughed and moved toward the door, Alex at his
heels.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t have been sent for that purpose, for he
was at the boat before the pictures were taken,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Yes, but, since then, he might have received orders
from the men, I believe there is something up here.
Those men back there may be train robbers,
who don’t want any pictures taken. Understand?
Gran might have come west with them. He might have
been sent over to us to get a line on our
intentions. Later, he might have been told to steal
the films! It is up to him to explain, anyway, but
don’t be too hard on him. Suppose it should turn
out that the men in camp, or the men back of the
camp, were really train robbers? That would be
awkward for Gran, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It would be awkward for the robbers if a kodak
located them on the scene of the robbery last
night,” Clay replied.</p>

<p>“Last night?” repeated Alex. “What about a robbery
last night?”</p>

<p>“The Pacific express was held up just the other side
of the pass very early this morning,” answered Clay.
“The express and mail cars were looted and the
passengers robbed. The two men who boarded the train
didn’t do it, of course, but there were others there
in the canyons!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVII'>CHAPTER VII.—PIE THAT LIVED IN A GLASS HOUSE.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Then,” Alex suggested, “we’d better be getting the
<i>Rambler</i> into the water and sailing away. If the
officers should decide to hold us as witnesses,
we’ll have a fine time on the Columbia, I don’t
think.”</p>

<p>“That is just what I have been telling Gran,”
replied Clay, “but he seems to think that he ought
to part from us here. He says he has no money to
share the expense of the trip with us, and that he
will not be what they call a star boarder on South
Halstead street, Chicago—one who never misses a meal
or pays a cent. I like his independence, but I’d
like better to have him with us. Suppose you go and
talk it over with the lad. He’s pretty blue over
something this morning.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he wants to get away from us because
he thinks we will be suspected of knowing something
about this robbery and followed,” suggested Alex,
all his suspicions coming to the front once more.</p>

<p>“And perhaps he wants to get away because he knows
that we’ll suspect him of taking the films. We’ve
just got to keep him with us, for a time, anyway,”
the boy added. “We’ll tie him down if necessary!”</p>

<p>“Well, the very best thing I can suggest at this
time,” Clay decided, “is to forget the films, and
the train robbery, and the way the boy came to us,
and go on about having fun with the Columbia river.
Doesn’t it seem that way to you? To get away is
surely the easiest way to escape any trouble
connected with the robbery. I’ll go and tell Case
about it, and we’ll just cut everything out but the
fun we’re going to have on the river.”</p>

<p>“All right!” Alex agreed. “There never was any
photographs taken in the pass, and there never was a
train robbery at the summit of the Rocky mountains,
and no boy ever came to us out of a dark canyon at
night! Say but we’ll have a lot of forgetting to
do!”</p>

<p>“And Gran is not to know a word of what we have been
talking?”</p>

<p>“Not a single, solitary word! Didn’t we agree that
there never was any films, and that there never was
a robbery, and that Gran came to us out of the
clouds, dressed in red and purple, with his pockets
stuffed with treasury notes? Trust me to forget it
all when I’m talking with him.”</p>

<p>Clay went forward and drew Case aside, leaving Gran
alone on the prow, and Alex promptly engaged him in
conversation. The stranger was still insisting on
leaving the party there, when Captain Joe, who had
been running about the car for some moments, uttered
a growl and started off on a run toward the cluster
of houses nearest the river.</p>

<p>Alex called him back, but the dog seemed to have
discovered a scent by the side of the car that he
wanted to follow. While the boys stood talking the
car bunted against the upright beam which terminated
the siding, and the Columbia river lay glistening
not far distant.</p>

<p>“Glorious, eh?” shouted Alex. “Say, but we’re bound
to have some great old times on that little
rivulet!”</p>

<p>Gran turned away his face and remained silent. Alex
grinned at this proof that the boy really wanted to
go with them. If his inclination lay that
way, a little argument would do the rest, he thought.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to leave you here,” Gran said, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“No,” insisted Alex, “we’ve been talking it over,
and have made up our minds that we can’t spare you.
There are lots of places, we are told, where it
takes four to run the boat. There are rapids and
falls which necessitate taking the boat out of the
water and making a carry. I don’t think you ought to
quit us now.”</p>

<p>The stranger’s face brightened in an instant. Alex
smiled again.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I can be of any use,” the boy began, “I’ll
be glad to go, only I have no money, and I thought—”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” Alex replied. “You’re going with
us, all right. Is it a bargain? Sure you won’t leave
us when we aren’t looking?” he added. “We’ll need
your help, you know, in lots of places.”</p>

<p>“Come on, now, and get ready to send the <i>Rambler</i>
into the water!” cried Clay, springing to the floor
of the car and then to the ground. “I wish we could
run this car into the river and float the boat off,
but that can’t be done, so I’ll have to go and get
skids and rollers and men to help. While I’m gone,
you lads get breakfast ready, and we’ll take our
last meal in this elegant old private palace car!”</p>

<p>“I suppose we can go over to the store and get a few
things to eat?” questioned Alex. “We’ll have time
for that, won’t we?” he added.</p>

<p>“Surely,” was the reply. “And have some coffee ready
for me when I come back. Perhaps you can get a mess
of fish. There’s the greatest salmon stream in the
world, running along at your feet and making faces
at you! But you must hurry up and get the food out
of the boxes, all ready to carry down to the boat as
soon as she is in the river.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get the breakfast,” Gran volunteered. “I used
to know how to get up a swell dinner out of a cold
potato and a sausage. If I’ve got to go down the
river with you. I’ll work my passage as cook.”</p>

<p>Clay and Case looked up at Alex who stood grinning.</p>

<p>“It is all right,” the boy said. “I showed Gran that
we would need his help, and he is too much of a
gentleman to quit us. Get a square meal, now, Gran,”
he continued, “and we’ll cut out the store and be
getting the provisions out of the boxes. I guess
we’ve got enough bacon and condensed milk
here to feed an army for a month,” he added, ripping off the
cover of a box and poking at the contents.</p>

<p>So Gran hastened into the cabin, from which the
agreeable odor of frying bacon, bubbling coffee, and
browning cakes soon came, making Case and Alex,
still working at the boxes, hungrier than ever.</p>

<p>Before Clay returned, the strange boy appeared in
the cabin door waving a pancake turner in his hand,
a pleasant smile on his face.</p>

<p>The knowledge that he was really welcome to go with
the boys and the prospect of making himself useful,
had acted like a tonic, and from that moment he was,
apparently, as full of life and as ready for any
adventure that might come his way as were the
others.</p>

<p>At times, however, he seemed sad and depressed,
seeking solitude and, while always willing to do his
share of the work, refusing to join in the by-play
which his friends often indulged in. At such times
the boys respected his mood and acted as if they did
not notice it at all. From these moods of dejection,
however, he soon emerged as bright and, apparently,
as merry as the best of them.</p>

<p>“Dinner ready in the private diner!” he cried,
swinging his turner at the boys. “The cakes are
hot, the coffee is strong enough to lift the boat, and
the bacon is crispy as a winter morning in little
old Chicago.”</p>

<p>“It takes a cook to praise his own work!” laughed
Case.</p>

<p>Clay came in directly, while they were eating, and
all agreed that Gran’s description of his breakfast
had been realistic. The men came before long with
their skids and rollers, and before noon the
<i>Rambler</i> was rocking in the waters of the lordly
Columbia river.</p>

<p>“Our dream has come true!” Alex whispered to Clay,
as the last load of provisions was deposited on
board and the men paid off. “We are at last on the
Columbia, hundreds and hundreds of miles from the
ocean, with a long ride before us. Isn’t it just
glorious, old pal?”</p>

<p>“Glorious!” repeated the other. “It is more than
glorious, and there never was any pictures taken in
the pass, there never was any train robbery there,
and Gran came to us without a suspicion clinging to
him.”</p>

<p>“Right you are!” Alex approved, “still, for the last
time, mind, I really would like to know what became
of those films, and if there were any faces in
the photographs that I did not see in the glow of the
fire.”</p>

<p>“That is your last guess,” laughed Clay. “We are not
going to have mysteries tagging after us on this
trip, as we had on the voyage up the Amazon. We’re
going to hunt deer, and bear, and jaguars, and have
the time of our lives! And fish! Just wait until we
begin to take those big yellow salmon from the
river! Just you wait!”</p>

<p>“There’s one thing we forgot,” Clay observed, as the
boys put away the provisions in the odd nooks
provided for them and saw that the gasoline tanks
were full, the electric generator in good working
order. “We never went up to wish that gruff
conductor good luck.”</p>

<p>“He is a gruff one, all right,” Alex cut in. “He did
put on a lot of authority when he first came up to
us, didn’t he, now?” he continued.</p>

<p>“But he calmed down when we filled him up with cakes
and coffee,” Case observed. “He didn’t turn out so
badly, after all. There’s many a gruff person in the
world who can be quelled by a little courtesy.”</p>

<p>“But you wanted to fight with him,” laughed Clay. “I
saw that by the way you looked at him. That would
have spoiled everything.”</p>

<p>“Good luck to him, anyway,” Case commented. “He must
have squared us in connection with the robbery, for
no one here has asked us a word about it. He
probably told the natives that we left with him long
before the robbery took place at the pass. Don’t you
think so?”</p>

<p>“What robbery?” asked Alex with a giggle. “It has
been discovered that there wasn’t any robbery at the
pass, and that there never was any—. Well, what’s
the use of talking about a thing that never took
place. I wonder if Clay brought any pie along in the
boxes?”</p>

<p>“Pie in a box—all the way from Chicago!” snorted
Case. “You must think they <i>can</i> pie up
there. But, say, how would a pie go just now?”</p>

<p>“That’s all you know about the haunts and habits of
pie!” exclaimed Clay. “In Chicago they have a
species of pie that lives in glass. When you want a
bite you make a blanket of flaky dough and take it
out of the glass can, and then exposure to heat
brings it to life in the shape of pie! What do you
know about that? Pie that lives in a glass can!”</p>

<p>“Did you catch some of them?” asked Alex, “because
if you did I want to see one perform. Which box is
he in? Hurry up, and I’ll make the
flaky dough blanket in time for supper. PIE!”
he added, lifting his eyes upward in a devotional
attitude. “I adore pie!”</p>

<p>“You’ll find berry pie, and pumpkin pie, and mince
pie, and apple pie sleeping peacefully in one of the
boxes,” Clay replied, much to the joy of the others,
who executed a fancy dance on the deck and then came
back to ask more questions about the haunts and
habits of pie. Whether it came out in broad
daylight, or whether one had to set traps for it and
catch it during the dark hours of the night. Clay
only laughed and fished out a two-quart can of
pumpkin, which he placed tenderly on the table.</p>

<p>“Be careful with him,” he smiled. “He will bite if
you don’t make the dough blanket light and flaky. I
have known children to need the care of a physician
after being bitten by a bad pie!”</p>

<p>“That will do for you!” Alex responded. “When we
need any one to tell us about the haunts and habits
and preferences of pie we’ll let you know.”</p>

<p>At this latest mention of the word “pie” Captain
Joe, who had been sitting gravely on the prow of the
motor boat, gave a sharp yelp and came trotting
into the cabin, his ears lifted—what there was of
them—expectantly, his tail trying to make a great
circle in the air with only a couple of inches of
stub in sight. The boys laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Do you recognize the word, Captain Joe?” asked Alex
patting the white bulldog on the head. “I believe
you do, you old scamp. Now, what kind of pie would
you like for supper, old chap?” he added, talking to
the dog as if he understood every word that was said
to him—which was a habit the boys all had.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they grow pie where you came from,”
Alex observed, in a moment. “Where do you think this
beastie came from, Gran?” he went on.</p>

<p>“Chicago?” was the brief answer. “He looks like
Halstead street.”</p>

<p>“Alex stole him, or bought him, or abducted him, or
shanghaied him, at Para, down near the mouth of the
Amazon,” Case put in, “and came near getting his
head knocked off. Let her go, Clay!”</p>

<p>This last was called out to the boy busy at the
motors, and the next moment the voyage had begun.
The <i>Rambler’s</i> nose was turned down the Columbia!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chVIII'>CHAPTER VIII.—A WRECK AND A BABY BEAR.</h2>

<p class='first'>Donald, British Columbia, where the <i>Rambler</i> was
introduced to the waters of the Columbia river, is
pretty well up toward the Arctic circle, about in
the same degree of latitude, in fact, as the Great
Glacier of the Cascade range, still it is not so
cold there in April as one would naturally suppose.
There is splendid summer grazing land between the
Fraser river, in that latitude, and the Pacific
ocean.</p>

<p>Being so far to the North, one would expect the
river, like a well-behaved body of water, to run
south at Donald, especially as the mouth of the
great stream is hundreds of miles in that direction,
near the thriving city of Portland, in the state of
Oregon. But rivers in mountainous countries have
notions of their own, like wayward boys, as to the proper
course to pursue, and so the Columbia pours
its waters toward the North Pole for more than a
hundred miles beyond Donald.</p>

<p>At Beaver the Canadian Pacific leaves the valley of
the Columbia and winds south to cross Dog Tooth
mountains, a parallel ridge of the long Rocky
mountain system at Glacier House pass, while the
Columbia pursues its turbulent way to the northwest
for a hundred miles or more, as the river runs,
until it rounds a great mountain peak and receives
the waters of the Wood and Canoe rivers at Boat
Encampment. This is the farthest point north for the
Columbia, as the stream turns abruptly to the south
there and makes for Arrow lakes.</p>

<p>Between Beaver and Boat Encampment the river valley
is narrow, and there are no settlements to speak of.
In many places the two ridges of the Rocky mountains
press down to the waters of the river. The country
is wild, and in April the summits to the east and
west show snowy caps, like stalwart nurses out in
the city parks, guarding perambulators and leading
toddling youngsters.</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i> passed Beaver long before sunset and
entered the wild region between the crowding
mountain ridges. It was dim and uncanny there
long before it was time for the sun to withdraw his face
from that part of the world for the day, as the
western summits shut out much of the light that
fell. The three lads, Clay, Case, and Alex who had
visited the wild places of Peru during the Amazon
trip, were wild with joy at coming back to the heart
of Nature, but Gran, who was evidently taking his
first degree in the wonderful order of Mountain,
Life, did not take so readily to the dark shadows
and the swirling eddies which threatened to tear the
<i>Rambler</i> into bits in punishment for her intrusion
into the secret places.</p>

<p>When it became too dark to see the river for any
distance ahead, the boys anchored in a little cove
cut out of the foot of a mountain by the beating of
waters, covering hundreds of years, and built a
roaring fire in the coal stove. As it might be some
days before they would be able to secure more
gasoline, the motors were shut off, together with
the electric generators, and supper was started on
the top of the coal stove.</p>

<p>There was plenty of electricity in the accumulators,
but the lads thought best to use only the electric
lights. Clay gave his attention to the work of
cleaning the motors, while Gran led in the
preparations for supper. The boys were hungry and
tired, and were promising themselves a sound night’s
sleep as the supper cooked on top of the little coal
heater.</p>

<p>“Bacon and pancakes!” scorned Alex after a time.
“I’m getting sick of bacon and pancakes! What’s the
matter with having one of the pies out of the cage?
I’m hungry for pie! Pumpkin pie! Ouch!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you know how to bake a pie on top of a
stove!” commented Case. “Why don’t you go out and
catch a fish, if you are so keen for something new
for supper. There ought to be plenty of fish in this
roaring old river. Get the rowboat out and I’ll go
with you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Alex, “we haven’t used the
rowboat yet on this trip, and we’ll see how she
behaves in the Columbia. Untie her, and I’ll get in
and take the oars. Be careful now, and don’t jump in
like a barrel of bones. This current is treacherous!
If we get a dip here it may be a long time before we
see sunlight again. Careful, now!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you boys ought to go out in the
rowboat,” Clay warned. “Why don’t you fish from the
<i>Rambler</i>, or wait until to-morrow for your feast?
It is too risky, just at night, and in unknown
waters.”</p>

<p>But Alex was already in the rowboat, which was
pulling hard at the line in Case’s hands. The boy
backed with the oars, and Clay helped Case on the
line, but when the latter was ready to jump for the
boat the line parted and Alex went swirling down the
river at the rate of a score of miles an hour. The
boys stood aghast for an instant, and then Case
sprang for the motors.</p>

<p>“Wait!” Clay ordered. “You can’t turn on power until
I put some of the pieces back! I had it unfastened.
Don’t touch it! I’ll see what can be done! Get out
your flashlights and guns. We’ll let the boy know
where we are, at any rate. I’ll have this motor
ready in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Cut the anchor line, then,” cried Case. “We can’t
let Alex go off in that way. We’ve just got to
follow him! Cast off the anchor!”</p>

<p>The excited lad would have sent the boat adrift in
the current, in which case she would have been
dashed to pieces on the rocks in a very short time,
if Clay had not interfered.</p>

<p>“You must be crazy!” the latter cried. “Alex may be
all right. We will have power on in a minute,
and then we can catch him, if we don’t bump into a
foothill or tumble over a sudden drop. Listen! I
thought I heard the boy calling. Answer him, you fog
horn! You can beat me when it comes to making a
roar.”</p>

<p>For an instant there was only the sweep of the dark
water against the <i>Rambler</i> and the call of birds
high up in the sky—so high up that the latest
pencils of light from the setting sun touched their
wings and turned them into burnished gold. Then a
long “Ha-l-o-o” came from down the dark river. In a
moment the sound was repeated, louder than before.</p>

<p>“That’s Alex!” cried Case. “He’s all right
somewhere, it seems.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Clay agreed, “he must have caught on
something, for the current would have carried him
beyond hearing long before this. He may have found a
rock in the middle of the stream, or a small island.
Hope so.”</p>

<p>“Hello, hello!” came the voice again. “Can’t you
send down a light or a gun? I’ve got into a mess
here. Hurry up!”</p>

<p>“Suppose we send Captain Joe down with a string,
and a rope tied to the end of the string,”
suggested Gran. “The dog would swim straight to him,
wouldn’t he? Then we could pull the boat back and Alex in
it.”</p>

<p>“Fine idea!” cried Clay, “especially as the boy
doesn’t appear to be very far off. Call the dog and
I’ll get a long rope and a string. If the rope and
string aren’t long enough to reach Alex we can pull
the dog back. Good chance to make Captain Joe earn
his food. What?”</p>

<p>Case rushed into the cabin and looked about for
Captain Joe. He was not under foot in the middle of
the cabin floor, as he frequently was. He was not on
his rug under one of the shelf-benches. He was not
in the cabin at all, and Case went out to the deck
again, calling softly to the dog.</p>

<p>“He isn’t out here,” Clay said. “I’ve found the
rope, so hurry up with the dog. He must be around
here somewhere. Couldn’t have left the boat without
our knowing it, could he? Couldn’t have deserted
us?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Case insisted, returning from a search of
the boat, “the dog is not here. What do you think of
that? Where is he?”</p>

<p>“He was on board not an hour ago,” Gran declared. “I
saw him back there by the boat, the rowboat,
I mean. Could he have started out after Alex do you think?
He certainly has gone somewhere.”</p>

<p>Clay whistled and called to the dog, but for a long
time there was no response. The mystery was, for a
moment, baffling, and then it was cleared in a
breath.</p>

<p>Captain Joe’s voice came from down the river in a
succession of deep growls, followed by a different
sort of snarling.</p>

<p>“That’s Captain Joe, all right,” cried Case. “He
must have leaped into the river and struck out after
Alex. That’s it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Never did in the world,” Clay insisted. “If he is
with Alex he sprang into the rowboat when no one saw
him. That is one of his old tricks, as he wants to
be in the limelight most of the time.”</p>

<p>“Is that Joe?” called Clay, making a trumpet of his
hands and calling at the top of his voice. “Is Joe
there with you, Alex?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” came back from below. “He is here, all
right, and he’s got a baby bear! Can’t you let the
<i>Rambler</i> down a little? I’m shipwrecked on a ledge
of rock. River turns here and I bunted into it and
caught hold. If you don’t take all night to get
here, we’ll capture the bear. Captain Joe has him by
the leg, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he has a bear?” asked Gran, in a tone
of disbelief.</p>

<p>“Just like him,” Case laughed. “You can’t get Alex
into any scrape he can’t get out of. If he should
fall into a volcano he’d find an ice box there. Oh,
you needn’t laugh, Gran! That is just the kind of a
boy he is. We thought we had lost him at Para,
Brazil, and he came back lugging Captain Joe, and
with a mob at his heels. Now he is cast adrift on
the Columbia river and finds a baby bear. But the
question now is, how is he going to get back to the
<i>Rambler</i>? I’ll bet the rowboat is busted all to
flinders!”</p>

<p>“Few of your prophecies of evil have come true
lately, Case,” laughed Clay, busy with the motors,
“so you may as well quit doing the prophet stunt!
Now, if you will come here and hold a searchlight
under this frame, I’ll put this burr on and start
the machine.”</p>

<p>Case did as requested, and Gran hastened into the
cabin to put the last touches on the bacon which was
frying in a skillet at the top of the heater. He
even grumbled a little because the supper was being
delayed by the accident which had broken the rowboat
line.</p>

<p>“Alex!” called Clay, in a minute, “is it safe for
the <i>Rambler</i> to come down there? What kind of a
ledge is it you and the dog and the bear are on? You
might look around, while you are there,” he added,
with a laugh, “and see if you can find a fish for
supper!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on with the boat!” roared Alex. “I’m
getting tired of holding the rowboat, and Captain
Joe is worrying the bear to death.”</p>

<p>“Have you honestly got a bear?” asked Gran “What are
you going to do with him? He might bite us,” he
added, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The boys heard Alex laughing and so understood that
he was in no serious predicament. Captain Joe seemed
to be talking confidentially to the bear.</p>

<p>At last the motors were ready, and the <i>Rambler</i>
dropped cautiously down stream, under full control
of the power and the helm. She passed the ledge
where Alex and the dog and the bear were, picking
them up with her flashlight as she went by, then
pushed slowly up stream again, coming to the ledge
with the current against her. At last her prow
struck on a rocky bottom, and then she was held
against the force of the stream by half power.</p>

<p>What the flashlight revealed was a boy, white
bulldog, and a bear cub, all in a huddle on a level
surface of rock about six feet in length and about
half that width. Alex had evidently been tipped out
of the boat when the ledge was struck, but had
managed to hang on to the short line, so the boat
was safe. Captain Joe was down at the water’s edge
with his great paws on the back of the baby bear,
which was trying its best to get its teeth into
action on the dog’s leg.</p>

<p>The broken boatline was very short, and so Alex was
pretty close to the water too. When the flashlight
illumined the scene the bear cub gave a savage
spring and almost passed from under the paws of the
dog.</p>

<p>Alex was heard to laugh and seen to grab at the
bear, and then the whole three rolled off into the
river and the boat, thus released, swept past the
<i>Rambler</i> and went bobbing out of sight. No effort
was made to stop it, for Alex and the dog were
drifting too, both clinging to the bear!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chIX'>CHAPTER IX.—THE MAKING OF A CEDAR CANOE.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Drop down! Drop down stream!” Case yelled,
excitedly, as Alex, Captain Joe, and the baby bear
swept by on the current. “If they get out of sight
they’ll drown!”</p>

<p>“What’s keeping them in view got to do with it?”
shouted Gran “They will drown anyway if we don’t
hurry and get them out. Let me go in after them. I’m
a good swimmer, really I am. Let me go in and get
Alex and Captain Joe can save himself. See there!
Alex is going under. Let go of me!”</p>

<p>The loyal youngster would indeed have leaped into
the river if Clay had not caught him. Case was
equally unreasonable, and wanted to send the
<i>Rambler</i> straight over the struggling figures. Clay
caught up the long rope which he had prepared to
attach to Captain Joe and tied it about his waist. Then he
took another rope and wound it about his
neck and shoulders. Case and Gran looked on in
wonder and impatience.</p>

<p>“Now,” Clay explained, “I’m going to swing the boat
in a wide circle and meet that precious trio as we
pass up the stream. When we get almost to them, you,
Case, take the helm, and you, Gran, catch on the
ends of these lines. Do you both understand, now—are
you ready?”</p>

<p>The boat had swung around while the boy was
explaining, and Alex the bear cub, and Captain Joe
were clearly revealed, just ahead, in the glare of
the strong searchlight. The cub, forgetting all fear
of the canine in the greater danger it was in, had
climbed half way up on the dog’s back, and the dog
was swimming for dear life. Alex had caught an oar
as the boat swept away, and was calmly floating,
well sustained by the wood.</p>

<p>“S-a-a-y,” cried Case, almost choking with laughter
when he saw that Alex was in no immediate danger.
“Can you people down there keep that pose while I
take a picture of you? That’s great! G-r-e-a-t!”</p>

<p>Clay now saw that there was no pressing necessity
for him to take a cold bath just then, as Alex
would be able to catch the line if it could be trailed
near enough to him. Later, he thought, some one
might have to go in in order to rescue Captain Joe,
who was paddling along like a major, with no
expressed objections to the load of bear cub he was
carrying on his back. Case explained to the others
that the only reason the dog did not protest was
because he was afraid he would get his mouth full of
water if he engaged in any conversation regarding
the riparian rights of the bear. Gran alone looked
grave in the emergency.</p>

<p>Presently the line was thrown and Alex seized it
deftly and proceeded hand-over-hand to the side of
the boat. Captain Joe made greater efforts, trying
to keep to his side, but the current was too strong.
Clay dropped the <i>Rambler</i> down as the dog fell
away, and Alex instead of mounting to the deck of
the boat, caught the dog by the collar and held on
to him.</p>

<p>The cub bear did not take so kindly to this, for he
snapped at the boy’s hand, and Alex gave him a
slight tap on the nose in return.</p>

<p>Case dropped his extra line to Alex with
instructions to tie it to Captain Joe’s collar. This
was done, not without difficulty, for the dog did
not understand what was going on, and the bear cub
made it his business to attack the boy, so all three
went under water more than once before the feat was
accomplished. Then Clay drew on the line and Captain
Joe went up serenely with the bear still on his
back. The lads on the deck were shouting with
laughter, for the dog was now complaining at
carrying the cub.</p>

<p>In a moment Alex grabbed the cub, tucked it, in
spite of protests, under one arm, and was assisted,
spluttering and dripping, to the deck of the bear
and all. Captain Joe, on his arrival on deck, at
once shook water over Clay and then gave his
attention to the cub, but the boys drove him off and
hustled the baby bear into a warm corner by the
heater.</p>

<p>Alex shivering with cold, soon followed, and the
dog, making peace with the bear for the sake of
warmth, sat down in front of the stove and regarded
the preparations for supper with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>Then Gran made more hot coffee, and put on more
cakes, and opened a can of baked beans, and boiled
potatoes, and soon a wonderful supper was on the
little table. The bear cub sniffed at the food, but
curled up on his rug again. He had probably been
lost from his mother a long time, and had been in
the water before Alex came to him, and was worn out,
still he kept a keen eye on the dog.</p>

<p>“How did you come to get him, Alex?” asked Clay.
“Nice bear, eh?”</p>

<p>“He was on the ledge, soaking wet, when the boat
struck it,” was the reply, “and the impact threw me
plumb on top of him. Then Captain Joe took a hand,
or paw, rather, in the mess and he became a prisoner
of war. You just bet he’s a nice bear!”</p>

<p>“If you keep him, and we remain around here long,
we’ll be apt to receive a call from his mother,”
Clay predicted. “What are you thinking of doing with
him? He’d make quite a nice meal! Bear meat’s fine!”</p>

<p>“Eat him!” cried Alex now clad in dry clothing, “I’d
as soon eat Captain Joe! What am I going to do with
him? I’m going to keep him, and train him up in the
way good bears should go. He’s a pipin!”</p>

<p>“That’s pretty near slang,” Case remarked, “and the
boy that uses slang washes dishes. That was the rule
during the Amazon trip, and we have adopted it for
this excursion,” he explained to Gran.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me about washing anything!”
Alex cried, with a shiver. “I never want to see water
again. My, but it was cold in there.”</p>

<p>He paused and looked at the bear reflectively a
moment and then arose and felt him over, his
advances being received with great discourtesy by
the bear, who had received the impression, it
appeared, that he was to be manhandled but not
invited to supper.</p>

<p>“Let him alone, kid,” advised Clay. “You’ll get a
bite that will make you sit up and take notice that
he has something more than white milk teeth if you
don’t. Where are you going to store this menagerie?”</p>

<p>“Why, he can just run around here like Captain Joe
does,” was the reply. “I was looking him over to see
if the dog wounded him, but he appears to be all
right. Good dog, that! He knew that I wanted to add
this teddy bear to my collection. I’m going to give
him to Captain Joe, the sailor man, not the dog,
when I get back to Chicago. He’ll like him for his
own sweet sake. Now, what do bears eat? Who knows?”</p>

<p>“Honey!” chuckled Case. “They rob beehives, I had a
picture of one tipping over a hive in my school
reader. Why don’t you call him honey?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; Teddy is his name,” replied Alex. “Come,
now, you fellows, tell me what to feed him. Will he
eat fish, do you think?”</p>

<p>“The Lincoln park bears eat fish,” Gran answered.
“I’ve seen ’em.”</p>

<p>“They are polar bears,” Case explained. “The other
bears eat bread and nuts and acorns. I’ve seen the
black bears dip their bread in the pool and eat it
in that way. Feed him pancakes, just for fun.”</p>

<p>So Alex seized a pancake from the table and held it
under the nose of the bear. The cub seemed to take
more pleasure in the “just for fun” experiment than
the boy did, for he seized the cake and a good share
of the hand that held it out to him.</p>

<p>Alex yelled for him to let go and gave him a cuff on
the nose. The skin was not broken on his fingers,
but the bear’s teeth had made indentations which
were a trifle sore. Teddy devoured the pancake
greedily and looked about for more. The boys threw
him pieces, and he soon became so tame that he would
put his paw on their laps and ask for food.</p>

<p>For a few days Captain Joe seemed to resent the
intrusion of this new pet, but Alex so Case
declared, explained to the dog that he, himself, had
saved the cub’s life by riding him on his back, and
after that there was peace between the two.</p>

<p>Teddy did indeed like honey, and everything sweet,
for more than once he emptied the sugar bowl, and
the very next forenoon he consumed half a pumpkin
pie which Gran was saving for dinner. The cook
rebuked him for this with a club, and Teddy was more
careful after that.</p>

<p>Contrary to expectations, the mother did not make
her appearance, and Teddy sailed away the next
morning without a formal farewell—and seemed pleased
with his new quarters and his new friends. Before
many days he became a great pet with all the boys,
though he always made unusual protestations of firm
friendship to whoever was doing the cooking!</p>

<p>The next morning Alex none the worse for his
wetting, was astir long before the other boys were
awake. He had determined, during the night, to make
restitution for the rowboat he had lost.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of cedar trees up here,” he thought,
“and if I can find a fallen one just the right size,
I can make a canoe that will take the place of the
rowboat. Of course,” he mused, “it wasn’t exactly my
fault that the boat was lost. The rope broke when
Captain Joe made a jump and landed in the prow.
Still, if I hadn’t been foolish with
Teddy, the boat never would have broken away from me.”</p>

<p>Where the great canyons came down to the water’s
edge, cutting the precipitous side of the mountains
into ridges, there were plenty of cedar trees, and
the boy, after softly lifting the anchor and turning
the <i>Rambler</i> down stream, watched long for a fallen
tree of the size he wanted.</p>

<p>It was doubtful if he could bring the boat close up
to the shore, for sometimes the land sloped
gradually down, and sometimes there were hidden
rocks which had tumbled from the mountain side, but
he decided to try to do so as soon as he came to a
suitable place, a place where there were great trees
growing close to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>A dozen miles down stream from the spot where the
night had been passed, the boy saw that the current,
setting against the shore, had cut a cove into a
bluff. Certain that the water would be deep at the
edge of the drop, he worked the <i>Rambler</i> in and was
soon overjoyed to see that he could stretch a plank
from the railing to a ledge which, being followed to
the north, would lead to a canyon of some size, the
bottom and sloping sides of which were lined with
magnificent cedar trees.</p>

<p>He cast anchor and laid out the plank. Then he
turned about to see if any of his chums were awake,
but all were sleeping except Captain Joe, who lay
with his chin on his paws regarding Teddy, still
asleep. Captain Joe seemed to Alex to be asking the
bear why he had presumed to use him for a ferry boat
on the previous evening, and the boy laughed
heartily at thought of the scene under the
flashlight.</p>

<p>He beckoned to the dog, threw a rope around Teddy’s
neck and fastened it to the railing, thus making
sure that he would not escape, and, followed by the
dog, stepped over the plank to the ledge, from which
he passed to the bottom of the canyon. The morning
was sharp with frost, but the atmosphere was clear
as crystal. It was like looking into a calm sea of
blue, transparent glass to look up at the sky
bending over the valley of the Columbia. The breath
of the cedars was sweet to the nostrils of the boy,
and the songs of the birds were pleasant things to
hear.</p>

<p>“This beats Clark street!” Alex thought, moving
about in the canyon in quest of a fallen cedar tree
of a size suitable for canoe-making.</p>

<p>A green tree would take too long to fashion into a
boat, and one too long on the ground would rot too
soon, so he hunted for a long time before he came
upon just what he sought.</p>

<p>An hour later, when Clay, missing the boy and the
dog, followed the plank to the ledge and then a
column of smoke to the interior of the canyon, he
found Alex sitting on a log watching a serpent of
flame running along the upper surface of a fallen
cedar tree. The boy had made a trench along the top
of the log and poured kerosene into it. Then he had
set fire to the oil, and the tree trunk was
gradually burning out in the middle. A pail of water
sat on the ground near the boy, and as Clay watched
he saw him arise and wet the edges of the trench, so
that only the center of the log would burn. The
flames, reinforced now by dry limbs gathered from
the thicket, were already deep down into the heart
of the long log. Clay’s approach was announced by
the dog, and Alex looked up with a curious look of
perplexity on his freckled face.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, kid?” Clay asked, looking
about.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see,” replied the boy, shrugging his
shoulders, “that I’m putting the roof on this new
ten-story building? What do you think I’m doing?
Even Captain Joe knows that, don’t you, doggie?”</p>

<p>The dog said he did, in his own way, and Clay sat
down by the side of the log.</p>

<p>“Somehow,” he said, “it is perfectly natural for
people to ask foolish questions. I knew that you
were making a canoe, Indian fashion, yet I asked
that question. Why didn’t you let me help you?
You’ll have a long job if you wait for that whole
log to bum out, and you’ll have a long canoe, too.”</p>

<p>“When it burns out about twenty feet,” Alex replied,
“we’ll saw it off at both ends, sharpen it up, dig
out the charred wood, and have a canoe that will
serve the purpose of the boat I lost. Don’t you
think so?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Clay, “but you needn’t think
you’re going to have all the credit of making this
canoe. I’m going to stay right here and keep the
fires going while you go to breakfast. The boys are
wondering where you are, and Teddy looks as if he
had lost his best friend.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Alex replied. “I think a little
breakfast would come in handy just now. I’ll leave
Captain Joe to protect you.”</p>

<p>“That will be nice!” laughed Clay. “Captain Joe
can do it, you may be sure. When you return,
bring the big saw and some knives with you. I
guess the chopping knife will be about right to dig the
charred wood out with. You needn’t hurry, for this
fire must burn a long time.”</p>

<p>Alex started away, but turned back with a thoughtful
look on his face. Clay smiled, for he thought he
knew what was in the mind of the boy.</p>

<p>“Say,” Alex said, almost in a whisper, “you haven’t
come across the films yet, have you? I’d just like
to know where they went to.”</p>

<p>“There never were any films,” grinned Clay. “You
know the bargain. Now, run along to the boat and get
your breakfast. No films, remember!”</p>

<p>Alex hastened away and Clay sat for a long time
watching the flames eating into the log, then the
dog sprang up with a bristling back and gave warning
of some one or something creeping through the trees.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chX'>CHAPTER X.—A RABBIT AND A SECRET MEETING.</h2>

<p class='first'>“What is it, Captain Joe?” Clay asked, as if Captain
Joe could turn around and tell him what he saw in
the thicket under the cedar trees. “Go slow, old
fellow, for it may be a beast you can’t handle as
easily as you handled the cub. Better keep back
until I get out my gun!”</p>

<p>Captain Joe continued to snarl at the thicket, and
Clay advanced a few paces and peered under the
underbrush which was clinging for fragile support to
the floor of the canyon.</p>

<p>He saw a human figure moving about, a tall figure
bending low and parting the bushes to look out upon
the burning log. The description Alex had given of
the man who had pursued him around the angle of rock
at the campfire near the pass at once came to the
mind of the boy.</p>

<p>Clay moved away, so that one looking into the space
where the log lay would not be able to see him,
whistled softly to the dog, and waited. Captain Joe
retreated with a growl of defiance and crouched
down at the boy’s feet, still keeping his eyes on
the thicket straight ahead.</p>

<p>The intruder had evidently not seen nor heard the
dog, and had no idea that he was watched, for he
pushed the bushes aside and stepped into the
opening. There he stood, a figure massive and
muscular, looking curiously at the burning log for
some moments.</p>

<p>Clay observed that he limped slightly as he walked,
and noted, too, that his hands hung almost to his
knees when dropped to his sides. The face was
masterful and intelligent. The fellow was evidently
the same who had been shot by the brakeman on the
Canadian Pacific train.</p>

<p>“Now,” thought the boy, “how the Old Harry did he
get here? And why is he here? It certainly looks as
if we had been followed from the pass by this
chap.”</p>

<p>The more Clay thought of the matter, the firmer
became his conviction that the man he saw had twice
before appeared in their journey from the Rocky
mountains to that point. He might have been one of
the campers, or he might have been hidden in the
canyon back of the fire.</p>

<p>Gran had suggested the presence of a party not in
view from where Alex had taken the snapshots. He
had given no reason for this supposition, but
Clay had come to the conclusion that it was a correct
one.</p>

<p>Clay regretted then that he had not secured more
definite information about the train robbery at
Donald. He had not even learned whether any one had
been arrested charged with the crime.</p>

<p>If the campers had been questioned and released as
innocent, then it was certain that others had been
in the pass at the time they were enjoying
themselves before their fire. The men who had held
up the train must have been already on the ground!</p>

<p>But, even then, this man and the companion who had
swung onto the train which had towed the
<i>Rambler’s</i> car away might have had no connection
with this second party. They might have been merely
loungers, waiting for an opportunity of getting out
of the mountains without contributing to the
treasury of the railroad company.</p>

<p>But why had they followed the <i>Rambler</i>? How had
they managed to get into the valley of the Columbia
ahead of her? Clay took it for granted that the
conductor had told the truth, and that there were
two on the train. He also accepted as true his
impression that the second man was not far away.</p>

<p>There were many questions connected with the
appearance of the fellow at that place which Clay
could not answer, and so he gave them all up and
devoted his whole attention to the intruder and his
movements. The man stared about the little clearing
for a minute as if expecting to meet some one
there, and then limped out in the direction of the
ridge near which the <i>Rambler</i> lay.</p>

<p>Captain Joe seemed anxious to interview the fellow
and ask him a few questions, but Clay kept close
hold of his collar and held him back when he would
have bounded forward. The dog resented this, but
kept quiet.</p>

<p>The long-armed man followed the canyon to the river
front, glanced cautiously up to the spot where the
<i>Rambler</i> lay, and crouched down in the shelter of
a rock, as Clay thought, to wait for definite
information regarding the situation on the boat.</p>

<p>Clay, following and watching, saw Case, Alex and
Gran standing on the deck examining automatic
pistols. He could not hear what they were saying,
but their gestures indicated that they were
thinking of going up on the mountainside to look
for game.</p>

<p>The tall watcher seemed to interpret the situation
just as Clay did, for he turned away with a shrug
of his shoulders and disappeared in the canyon,
which parted just below the place where Clay stood,
one dip running to the northeast and one to the
southeast. He took the one pointing to the
southeast, passing near the boat, and was soon lost
to view.</p>

<p>Clay made no attempt to follow him. Indeed, the
sudden appearance of the fellow there seemed so
unaccountable, so impossible, in fact, that the boy
almost doubted the correctness of his eyesight.
Still, there was the testimony of Captain Joe, who
was more than anxious to follow the fellow, and
this was not to be disputed.</p>

<p>The boy resolved not to mention the matter to his
chums. It could do no good, and, besides, such a
course would prevent a great deal of anxiety on the
part of the strange boy, who still shuddered at
mention of the pass and the happenings there.
Directly Alex came running up.</p>

<p>“How’s the boat-builder by this time?” he asked.
“Going along all right, eh?” he added, as he noted
the progress made by the fire in the heart of the
log. “I’ve brought the saw and the knives, as you
see,” he continued, throwing the tools down on the
ground, “and we’ll have a cedar canoe in about two
minutes and a half.”</p>

<p>He brushed away a mass of coals and cut sharply
into the bottom of the burn with a hatchet. The
result of his examination seemed to be entirely
satisfactory, for he rolled the log over, tipping
out the fire and crushing it out by rolling the log
over it.</p>

<p>“The burn is deep enough,” he said. “If it had
burned a few minutes more it would have weakened
the bottom. Now, I’ll bring some water from the
river, put out the fire inside and begin chopping.
We’ll have a canoe we’ll be proud of before long.
Great idea, what? Do you think you can ride in it
after we get it launched?” he added, with a
wrinkling nose.</p>

<p>“Of course I can,” replied Clay, indignantly. “All
you’ve got to do in order to ride a cedar canoe is
to keep your head and your balance.”</p>

<p>“There’s one more thing you’ve got to do,” Alex
laughed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the other. “Tell me about it,
so I’ll know!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to get used to riding under water about
half the time,” announced Alex gravely. “When it
tips over you’ve got to hang to it and wait for the
top to come around to the sky again. Do you think
you can get used to journeys under water? I think
they’ll be rather pleasant.”</p>

<p>“Where are Case and Gran?” asked Clay, after they
had chopped for an hour at the blackened wood. “I
hope they aren’t thinking of leaving the boat
alone. That will hardly be safe, in this wild
place.”</p>

<p>“Why,” replied the other, “they were talking of
going up on the mountain after game for dinner when
I left. They think they can shoot.”</p>

<p>“One, at least, ought to remain in the boat,” Clay
suggested. “When we return they may go hunting
together if they want to, only I wouldn’t advise a
long stop in this valley. We’d better be on our
way, I think.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s right,” Alex agreed, “for, come to
think about it, Gran was going alone, but I’ll go
and tell them both to stay on the boat. Have you
noticed Captain Joe?” the boy continued, pointing
to the dog, now snarling at a thicket farther up
the canyon. “He seems to have found something. I’ll
go and see what it is.”</p>

<p>Before Clay could offer objections, the boy was
away, chasing along through the brush on the heels
of the dog. Presently Clay heard a roar of
laughter.</p>

<p>“He’s got a rabbit!” Alex shouted, “and he’s making
as much fuss as if he had another bear. I guess
we’ll have some fresh game for dinner now,” the boy
continued, making his appearance with an animal
which looked something like a rabbit, but was
larger and evidently more ferocious, for the dog
had torn it not a little in making the capture.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it is good to eat?” Clay asked,
thankful that it was nothing more than a rabbit, or
something akin to the rabbit which Captain Joe had
scented out.</p>

<p>He had, as will be understood, feared that the
intruder with the long arms had returned to that
vicinity. Besides, the capture of the rabbit if
such it was, would make a hunting trip, such as
Case and Gran had planned, unnecessary at that
time. The boy was overjoyed at the outcome of the
incident, and asked Alex to carry the capture to
the boat and talk with the others about eating it,
also to warn them against leaving the boat alone,
even for a minute.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a book on natural history,” the boy
exclaimed, “and I’ll look up the pedigree of this
beastie. When I get back to the South Branch, I’m
going to write a book entitled: ‘Wild Animals I
Have Never Met Because I Could Run Faster Than They
Could.’ Don’t you think a volume of that character
would make a hit in the literary world?”</p>

<p>“Bound in calf, or sheep?” asked Clay, with a broad
grin.</p>

<p>“Bound in bear!” explained Alex. “And bound to
win!”</p>

<p>“Go on to the boat!” commanded Clay, “and see about
having that rabbit cooked for dinner. Then come
back here and help me get this canoe into the
river. We can finish hewing it out any old time.
Just now, I am anxious to be on our way. I don’t
like this dark valley.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is a wild one,” Alex answered as he
darted away.</p>

<p>Clay drew a long sigh of relief as the boy
disappeared in the direction of the boat. He did
not quite like the idea of running away from the
man who had three times shown a disposition to
pursue them, still, he believed that the wisest
course was to avoid trouble if possible.</p>

<p>He would have given a good deal for information
regarding the purpose of the fellow. He would have
endeavored, then and there, to have forced a
meeting only for the fact that an unsatisfactory
conclusion of a struggle might have spoiled their
long-planned trip down the Columbia.</p>

<p>Alex returned, presently, with the information that
it was really a large rabbit Captain Joe had
caught, and that it was to appear on the dinner
table in the shape of a stew. By this time the
canoe was taking form, and the boys rolled and
pushed it to the river.</p>

<p>Once there, they tied it to a strong line and
fastened the line to the <i>Rambler</i>. The further
work of cutting out the wood could, they planned,
be done at any time. Clay was not quite certain
that the cedar was in good condition, for the fire
had done quick work. He had read that Indians, when
they resorted to making this kind of canoes,
usually required three or four days in which to
hollow out a large log.</p>

<p>When Clay got back on the <i>Rambler</i>, he went
straight to the cabin and began another hunt for
the films. He had always believed that the
disappearance of the pictures had been accidental,
but now he wanted to make sure that they were not
in the cabin.</p>

<p>Somehow, the lost photographs were associated in
his mind with the men who, he imagined, had seen
the pictures taken. The man he had seen in the
canyon was one of these.</p>

<p>While he hunted in every conceivable and
inconceivable place, Alex came in and closed the
door behind him. The rabbit stew was simmering on
the heater and coffee was bubbling on the electric
stove. Alex busied himself about the latter, as if
to account for his being there with the door
closed, and looked at Clay with wise eyes.</p>

<p>“I know why you want to get away from here right
quick,” he said. “I know about the man you saw in
the canyon. He was there when I went in after the
rabbit, and there was some one with him. Now, who
do think it was? Give you three guesses.</p>

<p>“Give it up?” he went on. “Well, it was Mr. Chester
W. Granville!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXI'>CHAPTER XI.—ALEX BECOMES A DETECTIVE.</h2>

<p class='first'>“It doesn’t seem possible!” Clay exclaimed. “What
could have Gran been doing there? Could you hear
what they were saying?”</p>

<p>“Not a word,” was the reply; “they talked in low
tones.”</p>

<p>“But I thought Gran was on the boat.”</p>

<p>“Well, he left the boat, alone, just after I did. I
saw him go across the plank and pass into the
canyon. Then he turned in another direction.”</p>

<p>“He was back in the boat when you returned with the
rabbit?” asked Clay. “Of course, he must have been.
Well, then, he had very little time to visit with
that fellow. It is a queer proposition.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” Alex agreed. “Are you going to
say anything to him about it—let him know that we
are wise to his doings?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” was the slow reply. “If there is
something between the boy and these men, the way to
find out what it is, is to keep still and sleep
with our eyes open. Strange that we should have a
mysterious passenger on this voyage as well as on
the one up the Amazon!”</p>

<p>“I hope this one turns out as rich as the other,”
Alex grinned.</p>

<p>The breakfast, when finally prepared, was a light
one, so the boys had dinner early and then got
under way. It was much more convenient cooking when
the boat was not trying to turn handsprings in the
river. Now and then they came to rapids which any
ordinary caution would have warned them to hesitate
before entering, but Clay was anxious to get as far
away from his pursuer as possible in the shortest
time allowable, and so took chances.</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon they came to a quiet
piece of river some distance above a stretch of
rapids, around which the boat would have to be
carried. They decided to remain here for the night,
making ready during the afternoon and evening to
convey the <i>Rambler</i> around the falls early in the
morning.</p>

<p>Clay was careful to anchor the boat on the west
side of the river. They had come a long distance,
and if the unwelcome visitor of the morning had
indeed succeeded in keeping up with them by taking
to the stream in a light boat, he would have to
show himself if he passed, or even if he came
within a hundreds yards of the <i>Rambler</i> during the
afternoon.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Case, as the boat lay rocking in a
small cove, “I’ll go and catch a fish and show you
how to cook it. Here we’ve been on the river two
days and haven’t had a bite of fish yet. That is
what I call a burning shame. Do you think I can
ride that log of a canoe to the shore? I’ve got to
do my expert cooking under the leafy trees, you
see, and so I’ve got to use the canoe.”</p>

<p>“You might try it,” Clay laughed. “Alex went after
fish last evening and caught a bear, so there is no
knowing what you may get.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps an elephant!” laughed Gran.</p>

<p>“Or a bold train robber!” Alex put in, just to see
what Gran would say at the mention of the incidents
at the pass.</p>

<p>Gran looked up quickly, but there was no surprise
in his face. Instead he smiled and pointed to a
grove of tall cedars on the shore not far from the
edge of the stream.</p>

<p>“That looks like a fine place to fish for train
robbers,” he said. “I have a great mind to go
ashore with you to see you get the fish, and help
cook it. I know something about cooking fish!”</p>

<p>“Wait until he gets his fish,” Alex said. “When he
comes up with a corker, big enough for all of us,
I’ll help him cook it. I used to cook in the South
Branch until the policeman on the beat came to the
cabin and asked for my pies and things. You know I
did, eh, Clay?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Clay, gravely, “you used to cook so
well that the policeman got the habit of asking who
cooked the coffee before he tasted it. If you made
it, he had business outside right away.”</p>

<p>“You’re having another dream!” shouted Alex. “If
you think I can’t cook, just watch me serve the
cold beans to-night.”</p>

<p>“That is where you shine,” laughed Alex, “serving
cold beans!”</p>

<p>During this conversation Case had been getting out
his fishing tackle and leading the canoe around to
the side of the <i>Rambler</i> nearest the shore.</p>

<p>“Are you going with him?” asked Clay, of Gran,
hoping to receive an affirmative reply, for he had
decided to follow the lad if he went into the
forest alone.</p>

<p>He was not taking to this role of a spy kindly, for
it was with many twinges of conscience that he had
made up his mind to keep a close watch on the boy.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go,” Gran, in a moment, answered. “I
want to see the big woods. While Case is cooking
his fish on the bank, I can do some hunting.
Another rabbit stew would be about right. I always
liked rabbit stew! We’ll need it, too, if Case
doesn’t catch any fish.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that,” Case broke in. “I’m
the one that put the salmon in the Columbia river.”</p>

<p>“How are you both going to get ashore in that
canoe—only half finished as it is?” asked Clay,
presently, as Gran brought his gun and one of the
searchlights from the cabin. “You can’t swim there,
very well, for the water is too cold for pleasure,
as Alex discovered not long ago. I don’t think two
can ride in that contraption at the same time,” he
added.</p>

<p>Alex scratched his head. It was plain to Clay that
the boy was on the same line of thought as himself.
He, too, wanted Gran to go ashore so that he might
be followed.</p>

<p>How was it to be arranged so that the canoe could
be brought back to the <i>Rambler</i> after each boy had
landed? Then the boy laughed softly to himself,
wondering that he had ever given the matter a
second thought.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you!” he cried. “I’ll tie a long rope to
the canoe, and when Case gets ashore I’ll pull it
back. Then, when Gran gets ashore, I’ll pull it
back again, so there will be no chance for any one
to steal it.”</p>

<p>“Great head, Alex!” grinned Case, dropping off into
the canoe and tying a longer and stronger line to
the prow, in order that it might be drawn back to
take Gran to the shore. “You’ll be president of
some small country town yet. Now, don’t pull on
that line, young man,” he continued, as the rope
slipped through Clay’s fingers. “Just let her play
out easily, and I’ll have no trouble with the old
scow!”</p>

<p>He paddled to the shore easily enough, landing on a
little sandy spot where hundreds of years of wash
of water from the hills had ground soft rock to
bits. Back of him ran the forest of cedar, and back
of that the western ridges of the Rocky mountains.</p>

<p>“Pull her back, now!” he cried, taking his fishing
tackle out of the canoe, “and have Gran bring some
matches. I forgot it.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going to get your fish?” mocked
Alex. “There are no fishes along that shallow
shore.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind about that!” answered Clay. “See
that pool just below the rock? Well, there is a big
one in there that I’m going to have for supper.
When I get him caught, you can come and help get
his feathers off, Alex.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Alex answered, pulling the rude canoe
back, very glad of the suggestion that he go ashore
with the boys, “I’ll be there watching you when you
haul him out.”</p>

<p>Gran now entered the canoe and paddled ashore. The
new canoe was not much of a craft. It was just a
cedar log on the outside and a black trough on the
inside. Still, the boys figured that it would save
them many a wetting, for there were places
shrewd smile on his face, and Alex knew just what that
smile meant.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll meet our Robin Hood friend
again?” Clay asked.</p>

<p>“I think he wants to meet some one,” was the reply.
“He never went ashore just to hunt. Who’s to go
after him?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would better go,” Clay answered,
reluctantly, for he was aching for a turn in the
woods. “He’ll not suspect you of anything more than
a trick if he sees you following him.”</p>

<p>“What did he take that searchlight for?” asked
Alex.</p>

<p>“I can’t answer any questions about the boy,” Clay
replied, with an expressive shrug of the shoulders.
“He appears innocent, loyal, and honest, but he is
mixed up in some game which I believe him to be
playing under compulsion. You see if it doesn’t
come out that way.”</p>

<p>“While I’m away,” Alex went on, “you might take
another look for the films. It is quite important
that we get them.”</p>

<p>“And when we do,” Clay interrupted, “what do you
think we will find there? Just give a guess about
it!”</p>

<p>“Unless I’m mistaken,” the other replied, “we’ll
find a picture of a tall man with long arms peering
out of a canyon back of a campfire.”</p>

<p>“Just my notion! But who is this tall man with long
arms, and why does Gran meet him in the forest, and
say nothing to us about it? If he is in trouble,
why doesn’t he put it up to us to help him?”</p>

<p>“Well, well, well,” chuckled Alex, “here we stand
talking about films that never existed, about a
campfire that never was, about a pass never on any
map, about a pursuer who never lived! And over
there on the shore Case is building a big fire.
Now, Clay, just remember that there never were any
films! We’re not going to have this trip spoiled
with any mystery! What is Case building his fire
for before he catches a fish?”</p>

<p>“He’ll probably dig a hole in the ground, fill it
full of hot rocks, and make a regular oven of it,
before he gets the fish. Then, when he has the
bird, fresh from the river, he’ll heat up the rocks
again, wrap the fish in leaves and put it into the
oven, with hot rocks on top of it and under it, and
cover the whole outfit up with leaves and earth.”</p>

<p>“Is that the way to bake fish in the woods?”</p>

<p>“That surely is the way,” answered Clay. “Now, you
see. Gran has gone into the forest. Perhaps you’d
better be getting ashore.”</p>

<p>“I just don’t like this sleuthing business a little
bit!” the boy grumbled, as they drew the canoe back
to the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“It seems to be necessary,” Clay replied. “If we
are ever to acquit Gran, in our minds, of all
crookedness, we’ve got to know the truth, and the
only way to learn the truth, it seems to me, is to
find it out for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it!” Alex agreed. “If this was to be
done to get the kid into trouble I wouldn’t be
mixed up in it, but as it is to get him out of
trouble. I’ll go to the limit.”</p>

<p>Alex paddled off to the shore, which was not very
far away, and Clay saw him stop for a moment and
talk with Case then dive into the forest. By this
time the sunshine had left the valley of the
Columbia. Away over to the west, beyond the ridges,
it would shine on the broken country—on a new world
in the making—for an hour or more, but here its
rays were stopped by the peaks which shone, white
and still, above the cedars.</p>

<p>Clay sat for a long time, watching Case angling for
the “big one,” he had mentioned, and listening to
the call of birds high up in the air. Like all
feathered things they were abandoning the lower
levels and sweeping in swinging circles up into the
sky to catch the latest rays of the sinking sun.
Their wings glistened golden in the light and their
musical voices came down soothingly.</p>

<p>Case caught his fish, after a time, and proceeded
to heat more pieces of broken rock for his
primitive oven. Clay sat watching him piling embers
on the mound after he had filled it with leaves and
earth. It was growing dark there now, and no hint
of the return of Gran or Alex had come. Finally
Case called from the shore:</p>

<p>“I’m going to bring this fish over to the <i>Rambler</i>
directly. Have you got the coffee and potatoes
ready?”</p>

<p>No, Clay had not once thought of the coffee and
potatoes, he had been so busy watching Case and
thinking of what might be taking place in the
forest.</p>

<p>He hastened to the cabin, built up a great fire in
the heater, set a kettle of potatoes over, switched
on the electric stove, put the coffee-pot on, and
then turned to the little table.</p>

<p>Captain Joe, who had been asleep when Alex left,
which accounted for his being there at all, lay on
the floor playing with Teddy. The two had already
become firm friends.</p>

<p>The sight of the dog brought a notion to Clay’s
mind. Why not send Captain Joe into the forest to
look the boys up? He would do it, if told to, and
would be sure to come back if he failed to find
them.</p>

<p>“Here, Captain Joe,” the boy said, “don’t you want
to go and find Alex? Put on your hunting shoes and
go find Alex.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe sprang to his feet instantly, tumbling
Teddy over in a heap as he did so and, advancing
the deck railing, looked over to the woods. Clay
took one of Alex’s shoes and one of Gran’s
handkerchiefs into his hands and let Captain Joe
sniff at them.</p>

<p>“Now you know whom to look after,” he grinned at
the intelligent dog, “and won’t go loafing around
Case, even if he is cooking supper.”</p>

<p>Clay got the dog into the canoe, though it was a
wonder, more than once during the operation, that
it didn’t tip over, and, taking up the paddle,
started for the shore.</p>

<p>Case saw him coming and ran toward the shore to
meet him. Captain Joe arose to get foothold for a
spring, and the canoe went over, landing both the
boy and the dog in twenty feet of water. It did not
take them long to get to the shore, where Captain
Joe cleared himself of water by a few vigorous
shakes and Clay threw off his outer clothing to dry
them by the fire.</p>

<p>“You’re a fine dog!” grumbled Clay, as he stood
before the blaze of dry cedar branches. “I give you
a chance to have a run on shore, and you go and
give me a ducking in the river!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXII'>CHAPTER XII.—A BEAR, A FISH, AND A TREE.</h2>

<p class='first'>Captain Joe, in his best manner, offered the most
abject apologies for his conduct, and ended by
rubbing his wet muzzle against the boy’s hand and
receiving a forgiving pat on the head.</p>

<p>“If you’ll look after the boat, a little while,”
Clay said, shivering, “I’ll go out with the dog and
look for the boys. There may be something wrong
with them. They should have returned an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“If they don’t get back right soon,” Case remarked,
“they won’t get any fish. The oven was hot when I
put that big one in, and it won’t be long before
supper will be ready.”</p>

<p>“I’m uneasy about them,” Clay admitted.</p>

<p>“Then you go back to the boat,” Case advised, “and
let me look after the kids. You’re shivering with
cold! I’ll take Captain Joe with me, and we’ll dig
’em out in no time. Then we’ll bring the fish on
board and have a feast. I suppose you have the
other things nearly ready?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” Day remembered, “I put the coffee
and potatoes over, and they’ll be spoiled if I don’t
hurry back. You’ll have to hunt up the boys after
all. I’ll get right back to the boat and get dried
out.”</p>

<p>“But look here,” Case cried out, as Clay started
toward the primitive canoe, “how are we to get on
board if you take the boat back?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tie a cord to the line and throw it back,”
Clay solved the puzzle, picking up a stone. “I
suppose I can throw a rock sixty feet?”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Case. “I didn’t think of that.
Now you get back and dry yourself. And get supper
ready, and don’t throw the line to the shore until
you hear us calling.”</p>

<p>Clay paddled back to the <i>Rambler</i>, and Case, led
on by the dog, started off into the cedar thicket.
At first Captain Joe trotted along calmly in the
white circle thrown by the electric candle in the
boy’s hand, but as he penetrated deeper into the
forest, following a wide canyon running between two
precipitous ranges, he became excited and dashed on
so rapidly that it was with difficulty that Case
kept pace with him.</p>

<p>It was dark as a pocket in the forest, and the
underbrush made progress difficult, but the boy and
the dog kept resolutely on for nearly half an hour
before coming to a halt. Then Captain Joe bristled
his back, showed his teeth, and emitted a
succession of threatening growls.</p>

<p>“What is it, old boy?” asked Case, hoping that the
boys were not far off, as he was becoming weary as
well as fearful for their safety.</p>

<p>Captain Joe advanced through a thicket for a few
paces and then backed out, showing that, whatever
it was that he was investigating, it was not very
far away. Case did not urge him on, for he did not
know what peril lurked in the darkness of the
undergrowth. The dog continued to growl, but did
not again advance into the tangle from which he had
just emerged.</p>

<p>There was no wind whatever in that sheltered place,
and there was only the roar of the rapids below the
<i>Rambler</i> to break the silence, except that now and
then a night bird flew protestingly from a perch in
a nearby tree and winged to a more secluded
position. Case stood with his light on the thicket
for a moment, listening.</p>

<p>Then he heard a giggle from a great cedar in the
middle of the tangle of bushes. It was not a laugh,
but a positive giggle. The tree, only forty or
fifty feet away, was thick of bough, and Case could
not see into its top, but the giggle was repeated,
and he walked forward.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking that giggle! Alex was hiding
in the tree! Clay supposed that the boy had seen
the light coming and had climbed the cedar for the
purpose of playing a joke on his chum, so
he walked on into the tangle at its foot and called out:</p>

<p>“Alex! Come out of that, you crazy loon! What are
you doing up there, anyway? Come down or I’ll send
a couple of bullets up there.”</p>

<p>The giggle came louder than ever, and Alex’s voice
came down from the lower boughs of the tree.</p>

<p>“You might keep your light going,” the lad up the
tree said, in a casual manner, “for if you let it
switch off you’ll probably receive a visit from the
grizzly bear that has been keeping me up in this
tree for a couple of hours. And keep Captain Joe
away. His Grizzlyship could kill him with one
poke.”</p>

<p>“A grizzly bear down here!” cried Case, and the
next minute he was some distance away, whirling the
light swiftly around his head.</p>

<p>“The grizzly will like that, I know,” Alex said,
calmly, from the tree. “He’s a sociable kind of a
bear, and has been inviting me to come down and
accept of a furnished room inside of him. Suppose
you take a shot at him, old man? I don’t think he
intends going away until he sees my finish. And, if
I were you. I’d climb a tree before I shot. He
tells me that it annoys him to be shot at.”</p>

<p>“You everlasting, concentrated essence of cheek!”
cried Case. “Why don’t you shoot him yourself? He’s
your bear! What?”</p>

<p>“I clipped one of his ears,” replied Alex, “and
then my gun dropped to the ground and he ate it. At
least I heard a crunching that sounded like eating
a piece of steel. I haven’t got my searchlight,
because I had to throw it at him when I climbed the
tree.”</p>

<p>Case took the hint about getting up in a tree,
while Captain Joe looked on in red-eyed wonder. He
could not understand why the boys did not help him
capture or kill the big beast sitting at the foot
of the tree.</p>

<p>The grizzly had set up a protest at the
interruption of his silent wait under the tree for
the supper he had ordered, and was now sniffing
toward the bushes where Captain Joe stood. He kept
out of the circle thrown by the searchlight as much
as possible, but was evidently determined to make a
stand right there for his stomach’s sake.</p>

<p>The light wavered and traveled about considerably
while Case was worming his way up to the branches
of a tree, and so, in the uncertain light, the bear
kept going bravely nearer to the dog. Captain Joe
did not retreat. So far as Case could see from his
place of safety, the dog was getting ready to do
battle.</p>

<p>“Here, Captain Joe!” Alex called, “you’ll get your
dome of thought dented if you go fooling with that
grizzly. He’s been raised a pet, and doesn’t like
to have dogs seek his society.”</p>

<p>“‘Dome of thought dented’ is slang,” Case put in,
from his tree, “and you’ll wash dishes to pay for
it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Alex replied, submissively, “you just
dent the grizzly a few and I’ll wash the dishes.
I’m hungry, and I’ve a notion that Gran has
deserted, and I want to get back to the cabin. If I
should appear on South Clark street in my present
apparel, the police would pinch me for neglecting
to patronize the clothing stores. See?”</p>

<p>“The bear got you, did he?” asked Case, anxiously.
“Did he hurt you? Guess you got up the tree just
ahead of him! What?”</p>

<p>“A thousandth part of an inch ahead of him,” Alex
answered. “He got part of my jacket and the most of
my trousers. Hurry up and shoot.”</p>

<p>Case knew that the situation was serious, for,
unless he could succeed in killing the grizzly, the
beast might remain on guard all through the long
night Clay might hear the shots and come to the
rescue and he might not. Alex’s shots had not been
heard at the river. Still, in spite of all, he
could not resist the inclination to laugh at the
boy’s description of his attire.</p>

<p>“I can’t shoot him unless I can see him,” he
replied. “He’s in the thicket now, trying to look
Captain Joe out of countenance. Whistle to the dog,
and when he gets under your tree the bear will
follow. Then I’ll turn on the flashlight and
shoot.“</p>

<p>“Great wisdom, considering your lack of early
training!” cried Alex. “Here, Captain Joe!” he
called, “Come away from that bear and look up into
this beautiful tree! Come on, old snooks!”</p>

<p>The dog sprang away from the grizzly and backed,
snarling, to the very trunk of the tree. Looking
up, he saw his master among the branches, and
straightway tried to climb up to him, an
undertaking which was as loyal as it was
impossible.</p>

<p>The grizzly sprang forward and lifted a huge paw to
strike the dog, and that would have been the finish
of Captain Joe if Case had not acted promptly. The
circle of white light fluttered over the bushes for
an instant, struck the bole of the tree just above
the bear’s head, and then dropped to his neck,
where it rested.</p>

<p>The bullet struck the bear where the spotlight
rested, at the base of the brain, and he dropped to
the ground, dead to all intents and purposes,
though his huge body contorted on the underbrush
for a moment, and once or twice he endeavored to
rise to his feet. The bullet had broken the spinal
column and entered the brain. As the motions were
all automatic, they soon ceased, and then Case and
Alex after other shots had been fired, came sliding
down out of their trees, each grinning but white of
face.</p>

<p>“That was a good shot, kid!” Alex said. “You ought
to have the hide for a rug!”</p>

<p>“I’ll have it in the morning, all right,” Case
answered. “Just now we’d better get some steak and
hustle back to the <i>Rambler</i>.”</p>

<p>“But you said you’d have fish for supper!”
suggested the boy.</p>

<p>“How long do you think a fish will remain fit to
eat if kept in an oven after being cooked through?”
demanded Case. “My fish was ready to take up when I
came out after you, and that’s more than half an
hour ago. By the time we get back it will be burned
to cinders.”</p>

<p>Case threw the light over the boy and broke into a
laugh, serious as the danger had been. The clothing
was almost torn from Alex’s back, and drops of
blood were trinkling down.</p>

<p>“He almost got you!” Case exclaimed.</p>

<p>Captain Joe approached his fallen enemy and then
looked up at the lads with a gleam of admiration in
his red eyes.</p>

<p>“The dog knows,” was all Alex said on the subject.
“But, come,” he went on, “let’s get back. Gran’s
eloped, and we needn’t wait for him.”</p>

<p>“Eloped!” repeated Case, turning the light on his
friend’s face to see if this was not a new joke.
“Eloped with whom?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” replied the boy, determined
not to tell anything about the meeting of the morning;
“I saw him in here, just up there at the angle of
the canyon, talking with a man, and then the bear
came along—and I entered into conversation with the
bear!”</p>

<p>“Did Gran see you?” asked Case, wondering if the
strange lad had observed Alex’s peril and failed to
protect him.</p>

<p>Alex shook his head and plunged forward through the
trees. Captain Joe barked at his heels a moment,
and then ran back to the bear, where it lay on the
ground under the tree.</p>

<p>“Wait!” Case called. “You needn’t run away from me!
Captain Joe is asking you to come back and take the
grizzly with you. He wants some of that meat for
his supper.”</p>

<p>Alex returned and the two boys skinned a shoulder
and secured quite a quantity of bear meat, after
which they resumed their tramp to the river. During
this time Case had said nothing more to Alex about
the disappearance of Gran He did not like the
abrupt manner in which his questions had been
answered, and resolved to let the boy tell what he
knew in his own way and at his own convenience.</p>

<p>It took them a long time to get back to the river,
and even then they found themselves some distance
below the point where the <i>Rambler</i> lay, and where
the fish had been cooking. The long, foaming rapids
lay in front of them, indistinct in the dim light
of the stars.</p>

<p>It would be impossible for the <i>Rambler</i> to drop
down to them, for the rapids would have drawn her
in, even with her full power opposing, and,
besides, there was the fish, which might be worth
uncovering. So the tired boys trudged slowly along
the rocky bank, sometimes turning into the interior
to avoid coves, and saw, in the darkness, danger
rockets ascending to the sky from the deck of the
<i>Rambler</i>!</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIII'>CHAPTER XIII.—A MYSTERY AND A FISH SUPPER.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Clay is getting anxious!” Alex observed, as a red
rocket went hissing toward the stars. “He’s taken
the right course to hurry us, at any rate,” he
added. “It is a good thing we brought those rockets
along with us. We may need them sometime worse than
we do now.”</p>

<p>“How do you know how badly he needs them?” demanded
Case. “You have been away for hours, and it is more
than an hour since I went into the forest to search
for you. A great deal may have happened in that
time.”</p>

<p>“But Clay is safe enough,” Alex insisted. “If he
wasn’t, he wouldn’t be capable of sending up
rockets. If any one had attacked him, or he had met
with a serious accident, he wouldn’t be doing that,
would he?”</p>

<p>“I hope you are right,” Case replied.</p>

<p>“He’s just sending a notice, in red fire, to us
that supper is ready and waiting,” Alex laughed.</p>

<p>Captain Joe began to scurry on ahead, doubtless
smelling the odor of supper from the cabin, but
Case hastened to order him back. At the same time
the boy shut off his searchlight and reloaded his
automatic.</p>

<p>“It may be just as well to come up to the <i>Rambler</i>
quietly,” he advised. “After all, we don’t know
what is going on there. And I’m going to see about
that fish, too, unless there are loud cries for
help from the <i>Rambler</i>! I had a hard time catching
that bird, and I’m not going to lose a fish supper
if I can help it. It may be done just right at this
minute. Who knows?”</p>

<p>“If we break our necks falling over these rocks,
and drown in some of these pools, and brain
ourselves on a fallen log, and kill ourselves in
several other ways,” Alex grunted, “we won’t want
any fish for supper. This traveling in a desolate
land in the night without a light is just about the
fiercest proposition I ever came across.”</p>

<p>Indeed it was slow work, and hard work, following
the rugged, broken river line, but the lads pressed
sturdily forward, notwithstanding the complaints of
Alex and they soon came to a point from which the
lights of the <i>Rambler</i> cabin struck out on their
uneven pathway. The deck of the motor boat was
deserted, and there was no one in view in the
cabin, so far as the lads could see, through the
two small windows on the shore side.</p>

<p>Directly, however, they made out a figure moving
about in the cabin, evidently stooping low in
search of something. Then the great prow lamp was
turned on and the deck, the bulk of the cabin, and
the swift-running river for many yards about were
illuminated.</p>

<p>“There!” whispered Alex. “Didn’t I tell you he was
safe and sound? You’ve got to go some to get Clay
into a mess he can’t get out of.”</p>

<p>As the boy spoke Clay appeared on deck with another
rocket in his hand. Case was about to call out to
him not to waste it, but Alex motioned for him to
wait.</p>

<p>“Let’s see about the fish first,” he proposed, “and
go on board with a meal that will make him lick his
chops like a hungry cat. Cooked fish and bear steak
will make him take notice, eh?”</p>

<p>“If you keep on talking slang,” Case reproved,
“you’ll have to wash dishes all the rest of the
trip. I’m not going to warn you again!”</p>

<p>“I’d wash a bushel of dishes if only I might empty
them first!” exclaimed the boy, pressing one hand
to the waistband of his torn trousers. “There never
was a boy so empty as I am right now!”</p>

<p>By this time the rocket was showering a brilliant
red light in the sky, and the boys were arrived at
the place where the fish had been consigned to
Case’s rude oven. As the latter bent over to uncover the
contents of the pit Clay saw them from the deck
and called out:</p>

<p>“The fish is here, piping hot on the stove. I was
just telegraphing to you about it Wait, now. I’ll
throw the line across, and you can draw the boat
over. You don’t deserve any supper, but I’ll
forgive you just this once. I’ve got a lot to tell
you.”</p>

<p>“Is that the cause of this Fourth-of-July
celebration?” asked Alex. “If I sent up rockets
every time I had something to tell, there would be
something doing in the heavens every minute of the
time.”</p>

<p>“That is no fairy tale!” Case agreed. “Only you
know so many things to tell that ain’t true!”</p>

<p>A slender line came whizzing through the air,
secured to a small rock, and Case caught it deftly
and proceeded to draw in the heavy rope which would
bring the impromptu canoe to the shore. Captain Joe
was first in when the boat, if such it may be
called, came to the water’s edge, and Case signaled
to Clay to pull him across.</p>

<p>“Why not let me in?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>“All right,” grinned Case, “you may go if you want
a ducking. The dog gave Clay a soaking this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>So the canoe started off with Captain Joe as the
only passenger. As if to prove good character
and make amends for the mishap of the afternoon, he sat
with dignity in the middle of the burned trough,
and never stirred until Clay assisted him to the
deck of the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>Case and Alex were soon aboard. They halted at the
door of the cabin, anticipating a flood of
questions, but none came. Clay said not a word
about the delay for an instant.</p>

<p>Then Alex turned his back, and the boy saw the
ravages the grizzly had made in the wardrobe of his
friend. He said nothing, even then, but sat back on
the railing and held his sides. Indeed, Alex was
pretty well stripped. Captain Joe looked up into
Alex’s face as if asking why he had introduced a
new style of dress into the wilderness.</p>

<p>“The grizzly did that, eh?” Clay asked, presently.
“It is a wonder he didn’t climb the tree after
you?”</p>

<p>“Tried to,” replied the boy, looking Clay over as
one looks over the face of a fortune teller who has
described an actual event in the past, “tried to,
but I dropped matches down on him. They burned his
snoot, and he quit. But how is it that you know
about that? Did you follow Alex into the
wilderness? Who told you about the tree and the
bear?”</p>

<p>“When you got the fish out of the oven,” asked
Case, as soon as the other had asked his questions,
“didn’t you take a turn in the woods?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Clay, with a quizzical smile, “I
haven’t been into the woods at all. Never went
farther than the shore.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be Sherlock Holmes, Jr.,” insisted
Alex. “The bear came on the stage more than a mile
from here, and you couldn’t have seen him from this
spot. What is there about me that tells you that I
was treed by a bear? Come, now, smarty, tell me!”</p>

<p>“Your clothes!” laughed Clay. “You have no idea
that I would lay it to a fish coming up out of the
river and biting you, have you?”</p>

<p>“Smarty!” repeated Alex. “If you know so much about
what took place in the woods, tell me what has
become of Gran. Come on, now.”</p>

<p>“Gran has gone over the rapids!” was Clay’s
astonishing reply.</p>

<p>Case and Alex looked their amazement, but did not
reply.</p>

<p>“He went past here in a boat, a boat that looked to
me like the one we lost, and—”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did!” Alex cut in. “I saw him out there in
the woods. He was standing under a tree, and there
was a—”</p>

<p>“He must have had to hustle to get to the river
before we did,” was all Case said. The mystery was
too deep to talk about.</p>

<p>“You remember the waterproof paper and envelopes we
brought with us,” Clay went on, glad that Alex had
stopped short in his explanation, “well it seems
that he had some of both with him. How long he’s
been carrying them in anticipation of an emergency
like this one, I don’t know, but it seems that he
had waterproof envelopes and paper with him when he
left the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the answer?” asked Alex fidgeting
about.</p>

<p>“Slang!” cried Case. “I know who’ll wash dishes
to-night!”</p>

<p>“Not very long ago,” Clay went on, taking a sheet
of paper from his pocket, “I saw a boat drifting
down upon the <i>Rambler</i>. There were two figures in
it. One was rowing, evidently just to keep
steerway, and the other was laying on the bottom in
the prow.</p>

<p>“When the boat came in the circle of the prow lamp,
I saw that it was the one that got away from us
where we found Teddy, and also that the figure in
the prow was resting in a position which indicated
an attempt at hiding away from whoever might see
the boat from the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“Robin Hood, and Treasure Island, and Robinson
Crusoe are dull history compared to this voyage!”
exclaimed Alex drawing closer. “A man hiding in the
prow of a stolen boat! Go on with the dream! You’ll
wake up directly and find the fish cold!”</p>

<p>“In a second,” Clay resumed, with a tolerant smile,
“I saw that the person in the prow was Gran, and
that he was trying to signal to me. The boat came
along pretty fast, and I didn’t catch on to what he
wanted until it was close at hand. Then he lifted
one hand up over the edge of the boat and threw
something up stream. The boat moved on down before
what had been tossed into the water came to the
prow of the <i>Rambler</i>. I reached down with our
dipping net and got it. Here it is:</p>

<p>“‘Alex treed by a bear. Case approaching. You’ll
hear from me later. Keep your eyes open. Don’t lose
the f——’</p>

<p>“That’s the end of it,” Clay went on. “Now, who’s
ready to give the answer? Who rowed Gran away? Why?
What word had he started to write when he stopped?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got me going!” Alex exclaimed. “I’m no mind
reader!”</p>

<p>“What about it. Case?” asked Clay. “What’s your
answer?”</p>

<p>“I’m just out of answers,” Case laughed, though
there was a worried look on his face. “Look here!”
he went on, “we’ve been trying to escape the
mystery stunt ever since we returned from the
Amazon. Now, suppose we quit guessing and wait for
the answer? No one knows a thing about that boy,
and that’s the answer, so far as I know what it
is!”</p>

<p>Clay and Alex exchanged significant glances when
Case was not looking in their direction. They both
had a suspicion as to what the word beginning with
“f” would have been had it been completed!</p>

<p>Their supposition that the word would have been
“films” increased their wonder and added to the
mystery. To tell the truth, they had both believed
that, for some purpose of his own which he would be
able to explain satisfactorily later on, Gran, had
removed the films from the kodak, and now, if their
suspicions were well founded, he was asking, under
strange circumstances, that they be well taken care
of!</p>

<p>Case went into the cabin and found the fish safe
under a tin, secured by a heavy weight, on the
table. Teddy was sniffing about, and Captain Joe
was reproving him for his inquisitiveness by biting
at his inch or so of tail.</p>

<p>“Now,” Alex said to Clay, “what about it? The
message from Gran, the message sent adrift in the
river and caught by you, seems to indicate that the
boy never took the films—that he thinks we still
have them in our possession—that he considers them
very important! If he didn’t take them, who did?
Say,” he went on, with a look into the cabin, where
Case was getting out dishes and fighting the bear
cub to keep him off the table, “isn’t it about time
we annexed the wisdom of Case? The only reason
we had for keeping all this from him was that there
would be no talk about it which Gran might
overhear.”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll tell Case,” Clay replied, “but I
thought that there never were any films, never any
robbery at the pass, never any long-armed man
talking with Gran in the cedar canyon!”</p>

<p>“All right!” grinned Alex, “I’ll tell Case, and
then we’ll cut it all out of the menu. We’ve got to
do it in order to have any fun on the Columbia
river. But where will Gran end up if this thing
keeps on?”</p>

<p>“That must go with all the rest,” Clay replied.
“But Case is beckoning us into the cabin and we’ll
see about that fish. Of course I’m eager to hear
about the bear and the tree, but you can tell me
about that after we see what Case’s fish is like.”</p>

<p>The fish was excellent, and even Captain Joe and
Teddy were given all they wanted of it. Now and
then, during the meal, the boys looked gravely over
to the place usually occupied by Gran, but nothing
was said of the boy’s strange departure until the
fish had disappeared. Then Clay told of the meeting
in the cedar canyon, and of other strange actions
on the part of the absent boy with which the reader
is already acquainted.</p>

<p>Case was loyal to the absent one, and all three
boys decided to go down the river slowly, in the
hope that Gran would in some way escape from his
mysterious companion and return to his friends.</p>

<p>“But how did he get back to the river so quick?”
asked Alex. “He was away back there by the bear
tree when I last saw him.”</p>

<p>“There is a bend in the river to the south,” Clay
answered, “and the man who took him out evidently
had the boat hidden there. By going to the
shoreline at the bend he would save half the
distance. I figured that out before you boys came
back.</p>

<p>“And then,” Clay went on, “you came out at the
rapids, and so lost considerable time. The question
which puzzles me most is not how he got out, but
why he went away.”</p>

<p>“And in our boat!” exclaimed Case. “The thief must
have been just below us when the boat broke away.
Well, we’ll get it back when we get hold of the
scamp. It may be days before we see Gran again, so
there is no use in asking each other questions.
We’ve got to get the <i>Rambler</i> around the rapids in
the morning, and I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p>“I move,” Alex added, rising, “that we anchor out
in the river. We are too close to shore. I don’t
want any ruffian sneaking in on us in the night.”</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and the anchor was lowered over
a bar near the middle of the stream. This
precaution taken, the boys crept into their bunks,
but not for long. The mysteries of the night were
not yet over.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIV'>CHAPTER XIV.—A SWIFT AND PERILOUS RIDE.</h2>

<p class='first'>It was midnight by Clay’s watch when the boy heard
Captain Joe making a great argument out on the deck
of the motor boat. He hastily drew on his trousers
and a thick coat and stepped out of the cabin.</p>

<p>As he did so the boat rocked frightfully, nearly
throwing him from his feet. Seizing hold of the
railing, he switched on the prow lamp and sprang to
the motors.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in his mind as to what had taken
place. The anchor chain had either broken or been
cut, and the <i>Rambler</i> was swinging down into the
rapids. He called excitedly to the sleepers and set
the craft in motion.</p>

<p>The motors responded nobly, but the full power of
the machines was not sufficient to change the
direction. Stern first, the <i>Rambler</i> was drifting
with the swift current He could see the waters on
either side foaming over rocks, feel the grating of
the sides and bottom of the boat on obstructions
beneath the boiling surface.</p>

<p>Case and Alex came bounding out, their eyes
half-closed from sleep, their automatics in their
hands. For an instant, in a quieter stretch of
river, Clay felt the boat spring up stream in
answer to the powerful motors, but directly the
motion shifted again.</p>

<p>“Put up your guns,” the boy shouted to the others.
“You, Case, come here and keep the motors in full
action. You, Alex get a pole and stand at the prow.
Do the best you can to keep the boat off rocks. She
is bound to go down, and we’ve got a fight on our
hands. Steady, now.”</p>

<p>“What is it all about?” asked Case, his voice only
dimly heard above the rush of waters. “The chain
must have been cut!”</p>

<p>Clay did not answer, but took the helm and managed
to swing the boat into a smoother bit of water near
the east shore. The current swept against the upper
side, nearly tipping her over, as she swung, but in
an instant the prow turned down stream and the boat
righted a little.</p>

<p>“Keep her to the shore!” shouted Case, frantically.
“We can never ride those rocks. Keep her toward the
east bank, Clay, for heaven’s sake, or it will be
all over with us. What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Full speed ahead!” roared Clay. “If we should
strike a rock while headed for either bank we’d go
over in a flash! Our only hope is to keep her dead
with the current and fight her through!”</p>

<p>That was a wild ride. Time and again the boat
grazed great rocks, and more than once Alex’s pole
prevented a head-on collision with half-exposed
boulders against which the mad waters swirled with
terrible force, sending spray high up in the air.
Wherever there was a setting of the current Clay
led the boat.</p>

<p>Believing that the water would be deeper, the
course freer of obstructions, where the current
swung, the boy followed the drift for a mile or
more without serious mishap. The prow light showed
a rush of current the like of which the boys had
never seen before.</p>

<p>Now the sweep wound off to the right, now to the
left, now it dove straight at a boulder only to
turn aside at the last moment because of the water
already banked against it. The <i>Rambler</i> was light,
and the swift motors gave her steerage way over the
current, so in many cases she went over hidden
rocks where a boat only drifting would have struck.</p>

<p>Presently a deeper roar than that about them
reached the ears of the boys, and they almost held
their breath as a high wall of rock loomed up
directly in front. The current set hard against
this bank and fell away in foam on a curving shore
below.</p>

<p>“Now we are in for it!” shouted Case. “If we strike
that rock we go to pieces. It seems all clear
below.”</p>

<p>Clay turned the prow away from the obstruction, but
as he did so the current caught the broadside and
whirled her round and round, seemingly a motor boat
doomed to destruction after a hard fight for life.</p>

<p>But, when all seemed lost, a kindly fate sent the
<i>Rambler</i> against a round rock and held her there,
tipping frightfully, until the prow swayed away
from the precipice against which the current was
pounding with a noise like thunder. Clay saw the
opportunity and headed the boat out a trifle and
put the whole force of the motors against a rushing
eddy which swirled just ahead.</p>

<p>The counter current caught the boat and swung her
farther away from the rock, but not far enough away
to prevent her coming within a yard of it. A minute
later the <i>Rambler</i> dropped into clearer water, and
Clay swung her away from the banks of foam which
clung to the curving shore below. The rapids were
behind!</p>

<p>Clay wiped the perspiration from his face and
called to Case to shut the motors down to half
power. This done, the boat traveled easily in the
direction of an island of rock not far away.</p>

<p>“Shall we land there?” asked Case, speaking at the
top of his voice, for the tumbling water still sent
up its clamor. “I think I see a ledge where we can
get out if we want to.”</p>

<p>“What for?” screamed Alex. “Let’s get away from
here.”</p>

<p>Clay motioned to approach the ledge, and in three
minutes the boat lay still, with her nose against a
low shelf which ran a part of the way round the
rocky island and then ascended to the very top.</p>

<p>“The anchor is gone,” Clay said, regretfully, “so
we’ll have to hang on here with our hands. That is,
unless we can find something to tie to. Look about,
Alex and see if there isn’t a peak we can throw a
rope about. I’d like to see what there is on the
top of this boulder.”</p>

<p>Alex sprang to the ledge and walked a few paces.
Then he called back, pointing as he did so. There
was a steeple of rock just in front where a rope
might be made secure. In a minute the boys were out
of the <i>Rambler</i>, and she was tied safe and sound.</p>

<p>“That was a wonder!” were Alex’s first words. “A
wonder!”</p>

<p>“Seems good to get my feet on something solid once
more!” Case said. “I thought, at one time, that we
were out a motor boat, cheated of a ride down the
Columbia river. I wonder if there are many places
like that?”</p>

<p>“Lots of ’em!” Alex answered, with a wink at Clay.
“Most of them have to be passed in balloons! Isn’t
that right. Clay?”</p>

<p>But Clay was climbing the winding ledge to the top
of the rock which formed the little island and made
no reply. While Alex and Case were discussing the
peril they had just passed and expressing opinions
as to how the <i>Rambler</i> came to be adrift, the boy
was mounting to the summit for the purpose of
examining the river below, so far as it was
possible to do so in the night time, with only the
stars in the sky.</p>

<p>Directly he called to the boys, and they went
bounding up the ledge, half anticipating something
in the line of trouble. They found Clay standing in
the middle of an almost round and level space about
twenty paces across. On every side, save that where
the ledge wound up, there was a sheer fall to the
water. It was a very Gibraltar of a rock.</p>

<p>“Look at this, boys,” Clay began, “there’s been
some one here within less than half an hour. And
there’s been a fire here, too, a fire built of dry
sticks brought from the shore. Here are the embers,
still alive.”</p>

<p>Alex nosed about the summit for a minute and came
back to the others with a paper from which emanated
a peculiar odor in his hand.</p>

<p>“They didn’t cook here,” the boy said. “There are
no signs of the fire having been used for that
purpose, no scraps of food about, so I looked
around to see what the fire was built for. I think
I have found out. Look at this.”</p>

<p>“This,” was the paper he had found. Clay took it
into his hand.</p>

<p>“Do you know what it is?” asked Case. “I think I
do.”</p>

<p>“Well, unless I’m very much mistaken,” Clay
answered, “this is a bit of paper which once
wrapped what we call ‘red fire,’ used for lighting
up parades, and also for signaling. The people who
made this fire used it to signal from. There is no
doubt about that.”</p>

<p>“Then there are two parties about here, perhaps
three!” exclaimed Alex. “I think we’d better get
into the <i>Rambler</i> and scud for the Pacific ocean.
This is getting too thick for me.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the men who built this fire, and who
signaled from this rock, waited here for the
<i>Rambler</i> to come down to them a wreck, with her
crew drowned and pounded into unrecognizable masses
by the rocks? It looks that way to me.”</p>

<p>“They wasn’t waiting here to give us any Christmas
presents!” laughed Alex. “Come on, let’s be on our
way! I don’t like the looks of things hereabouts,
and Captain Joe is calling to us from the boat.
Hurry up!”</p>

<p>Clay examined the dragging end of the anchor chain
when they returned to the <i>Rambler</i> and discovered
that it had been broken by prying one link open. It
must have taken a strong tool and a powerful hand
to make the break in the massive chain.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” demanded Case, as the motors
were started once more, and the boat cut away
through the water. “What are they after us for, I’d
like to know? What are they after Gran for?”</p>

<p>“Answer in our next issue!” grinned Alex, wrinkling
his nose at Teddy, who was trying to crawl up the
table leg.</p>

<p>“I’m going back to bed,” Case announced, sleepily.
“There’s nothing likely to happen, and the
conversation carried on by you fellows is
irrelevant and immaterial. It will be three hours
before daylight shows out on the plains, and four
or five before this wrinkle in the world’s surface
gets any of it.”</p>

<p>So he crawled off to his bunk and Captain Joe took
possession of the sleeping place usually occupied
by Alex while Teddy climbed into Clay’s bunk and
curled up with his sensitive little nose on his
paws.</p>

<p>“I’ll sit up with you to-night,” Alex said to Clay,
“for I want to talk with you. First, when are we
going to get out of this?”</p>

<p>“I’m tired of mystery,” Clay replied. “Right now
we’re headed for the ocean!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXV'>CHAPTER XV.—THE RAMBLER TAKES TO WHEELS.</h2>

<p class='first'>“Straight through?” asked Alex who did not like the
idea of overlooking the hunting and fishing along
the river. “I’d like to get a shot at a bear and a
deer before we strike tidewater.”</p>

<p>“You have already had a shot at a bear!” laughed
Clay.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but that didn’t count. I was too high up
in the air to take good aim, and I lost my gun,
too. No, that doesn’t count.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence, during which Clay watched
the moon coming up over the Rocky mountains,
plating the rippling river and the brown crags with
silvery light. The air was still, only the murmur
of the water and an occasional protest from a bird
breaking the silence.</p>

<p>“It’s glorious!” Alex declared, presently. “We’ve
got to the point where we can appreciate a little
quiet. If Gran could come walking in on us now,
things would be about right, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Just about right—provided Case could catch another
fish like the last one,” was the reply. “I don’t
know what to think about Gran.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think about him at all,” Alex hastened to
say. “I’ve got rid of it all! I’m waiting for the
puzzle to solve itself.”</p>

<p>“Where did the boy come from, and where is he
going, and why did he come to us at the pass, and
who is he, and why is he meeting strangers in the
woods without our knowledge, and has he been
carried off by force? And many other wheres and
whys,” Clay laughed.</p>

<p>“I give it up!” was Alex’s reply. “As I said
before, I’m waiting for the puzzle to solve itself.
When it does, we’ll know where my films went to,
and that will help some. That’s the key to the
whole thing—the film robbery heads the list.”</p>

<p>There was nothing more to talk about, for no amount
of guesswork could unravel the mystery, and no
combination of words seemed capable of throwing a
single ray of light on the matter. The <i>Rambler</i>
ran on through the night, carrying prow lights and
side lights, and covered many miles before the
morning sun lifted over the mountains and looked
down on the river.</p>

<p>“What about loitering around for a time in the hope
of finding Gran?” asked Case, as he came from the
cabin, rubbing his eyes, and noted that the
<i>Rambler</i> was under full speed. “We ought to look
for him, anyway.”</p>

<p>“We’ve given that up,” Alex answered. “We’re going
right on about our business, fishing and hunting,
and having all the fun we can, regardless of all
mystery. We might look for Gran a thousand years,
in this wilderness, and never find him. Also we
might hunt for our lost rowboat until sheep grow
wings, and never set eyes on it. Some one stole the
boat, and some one abducted Gran. That’s all there
is to it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Clay said, comings to the assistance of the
boy, “that is all there is to it By to-morrow
morning, if we keep on at this rate, we’ll strike
the place where the Columbia skirts a mountain and
turns squarely to the south. At that place there is
a human habitation or two, and we may hear
something of the boy there. In the meantime, it is
you to catch another fish.”</p>

<p>“For breakfast, too,” chimed in Alex who seldom was
out of healthy appetite. “I’m tired of pancakes and
bacon, and fried mush, and boiled potatoes, and
canned beans. Oh, oh,” he shouted, jumping to his
feet, “there’s the bear meat!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether the grizzly will make good
eating?” Clay said, “but we can soon find out If
you’ll get Captain Joe and Teddy out of the way,
I’ll fry a few slices.”</p>

<p>“I bar that!” Alex exclaimed. “I don’t like fried
bear meat. Say, what’s the matter of parboiling the
meat and making a bear stew? That will be all
right. We’ve got potatoes, onions, turnips, rice,
and lots of things to put into it.”</p>

<p>“I wish we had a cabbage!” Case observed. “There
never was a good stew that wasn’t part cabbage.
Don’t they can cabbage?”</p>

<p>“Never heard of canned cabbage, but when we come to
the salmon canneries down the river we can find out
about it. You go and get the fish for breakfast,
and we’ll have the bear stew for dinner. Just take
the canoe and paddle ashore and fish in some quiet
pool.”</p>

<p>Case clapped his hands to his sides in quick
remembrance.</p>

<p>“The canoe?” he repeated. “Who’s seen the old
trough since the run we made through the rapids? Of
course it was all banged to bits. Now, what are we
going to do?”</p>

<p>“Make another,” Clay responded. “We can make
another in a day, or we can wait until we get to
Boat Encampment and buy one.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll buy one,” Alex put in. “It is too much
of a job to burn one out. We can buy one for a few
cents, of an Indian.”</p>

<p>“And another thing,” Case observed, “where is that
bearskin rug you were going to have?”</p>

<p>“Back there in the woods,” was the slow reply.</p>

<p>“Fish off the back end of the boat,” suggested
Clay. “There are fish in the middle of the river as
well as in the quiet pools.”</p>

<p>The loss of the primitive canoe was seriously felt,
for there were not many places where the <i>Rambler</i>
could get close to the shore. Also Alex mourned the
loss of his bearskin. Finally Case caught a
five-pound fish, and the choice parts of it were
soon frying on the stove.</p>

<p>After breakfast Alex proceeded to make his bear
stew, and Clay tinkered at the motors to make sure
that they were in good order.</p>

<p>“If they had gone back on us when we were in the
rapids,” he explained, “we should have been
drowned, every one of us. It was the headway of the
boat that kept us going right. I’m strong for these
motors.”</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning in one of the most
picturesque districts in the world. There were
white caps on many of the peaks, and the dark green
of the cedar foliage and the brown of the rocks
contrasted well with the sun-kissed waters of the
river. There were bird-songs in plenty, and here
and there a great fish leaped above the surface, as
if to inspect this strange thing which rode upon
the waves instead of, like a gentleman, diving
under them!</p>

<p>After a time the valley of the river broadened
out on the west until a great stretch of forest lay
between the shoreline and the distant elevations.
Perhaps the word valley has been used wrongfully.
The country in that part of British Columbia is
really an upland plateau, with mountain ridges
lifting still higher.</p>

<p>From its source near the Kootenay lakes the
Columbia falls hundreds of feet in rapids and
foaming cascades before it reaches the Pacific. It
is a vagrant stream, winding this way and that,
washing mountains and sweeping past high levels of
tableland. There are salmon in the river and all
kinds of wild game in the canyons and forests it
skirts, so it is an ideal water course for such a
trip as the boys had started out on.</p>

<p>About noon, when the sun shone hot above the
dancing waters, the <i>Rambler</i> came to another drop
in the valley. The boys could hear the water
tumbling over rocks, and the growing current told
them that the falls, or rapids, whichever they
were, were not far away.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better get to shore here,” Clay
observed, “and take a look ahead. I don’t want
another experience like that of last night. It is
only by the greatest of good luck that we are alive
this morning.”</p>

<p>“That’s the truth,” Case exclaimed. “And somebody
is mourning over a plan that didn’t work. I wonder
if they think we are dead?”</p>

<p>“We’ve cut out all that!” Alex broke in. “We can’t
have any fun if we keep our minds bent up into
exclamation points all the time. Look!” he
continued, changing the subject, “there’s a place
where we ought to be able to bring the <i>Rambler</i>
right up to the shore.”</p>

<p>The place at which the boy pointed did look
inviting, and so Clay headed the boat in that
direction. There was a break in the high bank of
the stream, and it looked as if there might be a
pool inside which would make a desirable harbor.</p>

<p>When they came to the broken bank they saw that a
small rivulet entered the Columbia there, and that
its waters, in some period of flood, undoubtedly,
had carried a quantity of soil away, leaving a pond
west of the river line—a pond which seemed to be
deep enough for the <i>Rambler</i> to float in. Also
this pond was almost shut in from the river, the
scrubby trees growing there filling in between the
two bodies of water except where the channel cut
the natural levee.</p>

<p>“This is a beauty!” Alex cried, as the <i>Rambler</i>
felt her way through the opening. “We might hide
away from a fleet of police boats here!”</p>

<p>Captain Joe seemed to agree perfectly with this
expressed opinion of the locality, for no sooner
was the <i>Rambler</i> within reach of the shore than he
sprang out and began investigating the situation.
Teddy climbed to the railing of the deck and would
have followed the dog only for the fact that he was
tied to the prow by a long rope.</p>

<p>Alex was off the deck almost as soon as the dog,
and the two engaged in a wrestling match on the
grass, a contest in which the boy came off an easy
victor on account of the dog not being posted on
tricks of knocking an opponent’s feet out from
under him. This over, the dog started off into the
forest, looking back as if to inquire why Alex was
not coming along with him for a romp in the
jungles.</p>

<p>“I believe I will take a turn in the forest while
you look over the rapids,” Alex said, his eyes
following the dog longingly. “We can have a run for
half an hour, and then get back in time for the
start. Anyway, why not remain here all night? That
would be fine.”</p>

<p>Before Clay or Case could offer objections, the boy
and the dog were out of sight in the thicket. Their
brush-tramping footsteps were heard for a time, and
then there were no indications that they had ever
entered the woods at all. Clay smiled as he looked
at Case, following the course the two had taken
with his eyes.</p>

<p>“After we have a look at the rapids,” Clay
promised, “we’ll go hunting in there. Unless I am
much mistaken, we’ll find deer not far away from
this valley. Venison would make a hit with me just
now.”</p>

<p>“That sounds good to me,” Case answered. “We ought
to get fresh meat before long, for our bacon is
giving out. Now for the rapids!”</p>

<p>The rapids were more formidable than the boys had
expected to find them. The bed of the river seemed
to drop away several feet to the north, and the
narrowing channel was spotted with boulders which
fretted the current into foaming eddies. There
seemed to be no main channel, such as Clay had
followed through the peril above.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ll have to put on the wheels,” Clay
observed as he stood looking over the swirling
surface of the broken river. “We can never sail the
<i>Rambler</i> through there. Anyway, suppose we look
for a place level enough to run the boat through.
This bank looks good and level, and it seems to
remain so for some distance, skirting the rapids
like a highway. Do you know where the wheels are?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Case. “They are under the
floor in the prow.”</p>

<p>The boys returned to the <i>Rambler</i> and lifted a
hatch in the deck close to the forward stem. From
the cavity underneath Case drew four wheels of
about two feet in diameter. They were of iron,
light as possible, with broad tires. Next came two
long iron rods, with fittings at each end for the
wheels. These were the axles. Then came great
staples, shaped like a horseshoe, washers, and
screws.</p>

<p>“How we ever going to get them on?” asked Case. “We
neglected to hold dress rehearsals with these
things!”</p>

<p>“I’ve studied that all out,” Clay said, proudly.
“We’ll have to take to the water to screw these
horseshoe staples onto the sides of the boat. There
are four iron plates with screwholes where they go
on. Oh, come on! I’ll show you as we go along.”</p>

<p>The boys worked steadily, understanding, and fortune
favored them, so, in a couple of hours the wheels
were in place, and the prow of the <i>Rambler</i> was
out of water.</p>

<p>“Now, when Alex comes,” Clay said, “we’ll pull her
out.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXVI'>CHAPTER XVI.—TEDDY RECEIVES A CALLER.</h2>

<p class='first'>The sun dropped out of the sky above the valley,
glinting the rough elevations to the east with
golden light, but throwing long shadows where the
<i>Rambler</i> lay, half in the water and half out.
Still, Alex and the dog remained away, and there
were no indications of their approach.</p>

<p>“The next time Alex leaves the boat,” Case
grumbled, “we’ll tie a rope to him, so we can haul
him back. He holds the blue ribbon for getting lost
and meeting with foolish adventures.”</p>

<p>Teddy, the cub bear, by this time a chosen chum of
the white bulldog, sat up on the prow of the
<i>Rambler</i>, listening for the return of his
playmate, his small ears bent forward expectantly.
Occasionally he turned his nose to the west,
sniffing at the light breeze now blowing from that
direction. Clay called Case’s attention to the
movements of the cub.</p>

<p>“I believe he scents Captain Joe!” the boy said.
“He appears to be uneasy and expectant. The little
chap has us beaten when it comes to discovering an
approach not yet in sight. Anyway, he scents
something.”</p>

<p>The boys were not in the boat, which lay at a great
angle, the prow being on the land and the stern in
the water, but were standing half concealed in the
undergrowth which here fringed the natural levee.
As the shadows grew longer, the boat more
indistinct, a rustling was heard in the brush away
to the west, up the rivulet, and then a heavy
figure shambled into view. Case caught Clay by the
arm and whispered:</p>

<p>“That’s Alex coming back with some of his
monkeyshines! We’ll just lie still and see what
he’ll make of the rakish attitude of the <i>Rambler</i>.
Captain Joe is not with him, so he must have told
the dog to lay low while he plays a trick on us.
We’ll show him.”</p>

<p>The figure which had left the undergrowth was
merely a dark bulk, moving cautiously toward the
boat, on the same side of the pool as that on which
the boys stood. It was without outline, and would
not have been observed if it had remained
stationary. It drew nearer to the <i>Rambler</i>
noiselessly, like a person resolved to surprise an
unsuspecting foe.</p>

<p>Teddy now began uttering low, coaxing whines,
almost like those of a puppy at sight of its mother,
and the boys hastily drew out their automatics and
their searchlights, without which they never left
the boat. The moving figure sprang forward, and
then the growl that came out of the darkness left
no doubt in the minds of the boys as to what it was
that was paying a visit to their boat. Case pulled
Clay by the arm again.</p>

<p>“That is a grizzly!” he cried. “A grizzly weighing
about a ton and a half, come to see if Teddy is
perfectly contented in his new home.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!” warned Clay. “We may not be as lucky
as you were in the bush back yonder, and a wounded
grizzly is a wicked thing to fight. Wait and see
what she will do. Sure as you live, she’s going to
board the <i>Rambler</i>! What do you think Teddy will
do?”</p>

<p>“The question with me,” Case replied, “is not what
Teddy will do, but what the bear will do. She can
make a mess of that cabin in about a minute and a
half! If I thought I wouldn’t hit Teddy, I’d shoot
and frighten her off. Wish we could reach the
switch that throws on the prow light! That would
give her a shock, all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let them have their visit!” Clay replied, with
a silent but pronounced chuckle. “We ought to feel
grateful to the bear for going to the trouble of
calling on us. I hope Captain Joe will keep away
for a while yet. He would make trouble, I’m afraid.
Hear the two talking together! I’d like to know
what kind of a tale Teddy is telling.”</p>

<p>Teddy was whining like a puppy and the newcomer was
uttering low and threatening growls. It was evident
that she knew that hostile creatures were not far
away. The boys could see only the dim figures
moving about, but it seemed that the bear was
trying to coax Teddy away, and that Teddy was
trying to obey but was held back by the rope.</p>

<p>“She’ll bite through the rope!” Case whispered,
“and Teddy will get away if we don’t do something
before long. Alex wouldn’t like to lose the little
scamp. Suppose we throw a bit of electricity at
her,” he went on. “She might run at the sight of
the light.”</p>

<p>Presently they heard a crash in the cabin, as if
the grizzly had taken full possession there and was
rearranging the furniture to suit her personal
tastes. It sounded as if she had climbed up on the
table and broken it down with her great weight.
Clay’s whispered estimate was that she must weigh
nearly a ton.</p>

<p>“I know what she’s doing,” Clay chuckled. “There is
a box of sugar on a shelf near the door, and she is
trying to get that. She’s got her nerve, to invite
herself to supper and then break the furniture!”</p>

<p>A shot and a loud call now came from the dark
forest, and Captain Joe’s deep voice came booming
out of the shadows. The boy and the dog were
returning, and the situation was becoming more
complicated.</p>

<p>“If Captain Joe comes up,” Clay whispered, “he’ll
attack the bear, and she’ll give him one swipe and
then there won’t be any Captain Joe. We’ll have to
turn on our lights and shoot. Only be careful!”</p>

<p>The dog’s voice came nearer and nearer. It was
evident that Alex was bringing in some kind of
game, and that Captain Joe was making a kind of
triumphal progress for him!</p>

<p>The grizzly was now making a great noise in the
cabin, and Teddy was expressing his anger at the
lack of attention. The boys crept toward the boat
and waited for the bear to emerge from the cabin,
so they could get a shot at her, but she seemed
satisfied with the trouble she was making on the
inside and remained there. Clay moved along toward
the prow, his automatic ready for use.</p>

<p>“What now?” demanded Case, keeping at his side.</p>

<p>“I’m going to turn on the prow light,” Clay
replied. “We can’t do any shooting by the light of
the electrics. If she moves at all, as she will, of
course, she’ll be in the dark. Don’t come with me,
but get where you can shoot without hitting me.
I’ll be at the back of the boat, understand? Alex
and the dog are not far away now, and so we’ve got to do
whatever is done right quick. Don’t miss when
you shoot!”</p>

<p>“I won’t miss if I can help it,” replied the boy.
“You don’t think I want to be devoured by the bear,
do you. Shoot straight yourself!”</p>

<p>Clay moved slowly back, entered the water, clinging
to the side of the boat, now rocking violently
because of the tumbling going on inside the cabin,
and finally reached out for the electric switch.</p>

<p>When Alex and Captain Joe emerged from the thicket,
a second later, they saw a sight which stopped
their breath as well as their legs for an instant.
The deck of the <i>Rambler</i> lay at an angle of about
thirty degrees, cocked up on wheels in front and
resting in the water at the rear. On the prow sat
Teddy, all wound up in his rope because of his
twistings to get away, and from out the door of the
cabin looked the stolid face of a huge grizzly
bear, her little eyes flaming with rage, her teeth
showing where the snarling lips were drawn back.
Neither Clay nor Case was in sight.</p>

<p>Captain Joe bounded forward at first, but stopped
at a call from the boy. Teddy sat up straighter and
welcomed the dog with a whine, thus transferring
his loyalty from the bear to the canine.</p>

<p>“Hey, there!” Alex called out. “Where are you? I
didn’t know we kept furnished rooms to rent on the
<i>Rambler</i>! Who’s your new tenant?”</p>

<p>Then shots came from the prow of the boat and bruin
rushed for the deck, but the incline was
considerable and one of the shots had taken effect
in her shoulder, so she fell and rolled, snarling,
back to the door of the cabin. More shots came from
the prow, and she arose and struck at the air with
her great paws, as if trying to meet the bullets
with all her brute force.</p>

<p>Presently she fell, wounded to the death, and then
Alex saw Case and Clay enter the lighted space and
fire shot after shot at the bear.</p>

<p>“Save the lead!” the boy called. “Come back,
Captain Joe!”</p>

<p>But Captain Joe had no intention of missing the
final act in the tragedy in progress on the deck of
the <i>Rambler</i>. He sprang to the side of the boat,
looked up at the elevated prow, expressed his
disapproval of the arrangement by a low growl, and,
walking back, entered the rivulet and so climbed
over the lower end of the vessel, where it lay down
in the water. Teddy watched him with twinkling eyes
as he approached the body of the bear. Satisfied
that the grizzly was harmless, the dog slipped up
to the cub and looked him over. The boys broke into
laughter.</p>

<p>“Captain Joe knows that there’s been trouble here,”
Clay said. “He is sizing up the damage. Wise old
scout, that.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we size up the damage in the cabin?” Case
exclaimed, darting through the doorway and
switching on the lights.</p>

<p>The cabin was in a mess, to express it mildly.
Bruin had broken down the table while trying to
reach the sugar, and the bear stew left over from
dinner was standing in puddles on the floor. The
coal heater was standing at an alarming angle—one
of the legs having been knocked out from under it.
The bunks looked as if the bear had tried to sleep
in each one of them and found them all inconvenient
on account of size.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” Alex cried, “I’ve got plenty of game
out on the bank. We’ll have a partridge supper, and
give Teddy an extra share for bringing this big
fellow here. Say, but he’s a monster, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“That is a she bear,” replied Case. “A she bear,
like the one that came out of the wilderness and
devoured forty children because they called a
prophet names. I hated to shoot her, because she
came here as a guest, but I thought I’d rather eat
her than have her eat me.”</p>

<p>“Teddy seemed to make friends with her until
Captain Joe arrived,” Clay declared, “but when the
dog showed up the cub’s allegiance turned to him.
Which is the way of the world, after all!”</p>

<p>The boys set to work straightening up the cabin
and, this accomplished, they dragged the great
carcase of the grizzly to the shore and proceeded
to skin it. Some of the meat was laid away for the
next day, Alex’s catch providing for the supper
that night.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to draw lots for the rug the hide will
make,” Clay said, as, hunter fashion, they worked
salt into the green skin and hung it up.</p>

<p>“I ought to have it,” Alex insisted. “I shot the
first bear.”</p>

<p>“Case ought to have it,” Clay advised, “because he
shot this one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” Alex considered, “we’ll all have this
one in the club room we’re going to fit up in
Chicago this winter.”</p>

<p>“Now, about supper,” Case began, as they all
assembled on the deck again. “How are we going to
cook supper on this tipsy old boat?”</p>

<p>“We can build a big fire on shore,” suggested Clay.</p>

<p>This was finally agreed to, and a roaring fire soon
shot up in the tangle on the north bank of the
creek. There supper was cooked and eaten, and then
thoughts of sleep came to the tired boys.</p>

<p>“I think we’ve done wrong in building this fire,”
Clay said. “We might just as well have sent up
rockets telling our enemies where we are.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’s any one within forty miles
of us,” Alex put in, optimistically.</p>

<p>“What about the signals burned on the rock up
stream?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was a long way off. We’d better be
thinking of how we’re going to pull this boat
around the rapids than worrying over people hidden
in the bushes, watching Case eat more than is good
for him. He’s a wonderful hand at table,” he added,
as Case threw a potato at his head. “But, then,” he
added, in a conciliatory tone, “I’m something of an
eater myself.”</p>

<p>“Who’s going to watch to-night?” asked Case,
presently. “Some one ought to. I don’t think we
ought to take chances, here on the shore. There may
be more bears in the woods.”</p>

<p>It was finally arranged that Case should watch
until midnight, and that Alex should relieve him
then. Somehow, there was an uneasy feeling in the
air.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXVII'>CHAPTER XVII.—CAPTAIN JOE TO THE RESCUE.</h2>

<p class='first'>Clay went to his bunk early, but could not sleep.
The events of the day had been exciting, and the
danger was not yet past. Besides, his bed sloped
with the body of the boat, and he had a sense of
trying to sleep standing up. He could hear Alex
tumbling about in his bunk, censuring Captain Joe,
who seemed to be going through some kind of a
performance for the exclusive benefit of Teddy, the
bear cub.</p>

<p>Case was moving about on deck, and Clay smiled as
he imagined him clinging to the railing to keep his
footing on the tilting planks. The prow lamp was
out, and there were no lights in the cabin. There
were stars early in the evening, but clouds came up
after a time, and it was dark as a chamber in the
Mammoth Cave before ten o’clock.</p>

<p>Presently it began to rain. The water fell in great
sheets, and the wind, rising steadily, drove it
into every crevice in the light sheathing of the
cabin. The drops drummed on the deck like
hailstones.</p>

<p>Clay heard Case enter the cabin to prevent getting
soaked, and heard him talking to Teddy, whom he
seemed to have taken into his arms. Then the tired
boy dropped off into sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke Case was shaking him by the shoulder,
and the boat was rocking and bobbing up and down,
as if in the water the whole length, and not half
in, as it had been when he went to sleep. He sat up
on the side of his bunk and saw that every light on
the boat was burning.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you switch off the lights and let me
sleep?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Hear it rain!” Case advised. “And feel the
<i>Rambler</i> nodding to the rising water! Do you know
where we can find that extra anchor?”</p>

<p>“It ought to be in there where the wheels were,”
Clay replied, getting out on the floor and
stumbling over Teddy, who at once retaliated by
biting and clawing at his bare legs. Case drew the
cub away by the tail.</p>

<p>“You’ll get put on the dunce block, Mr. Teddy,” he
said, “if you don’t cultivate better manners You’re
always under foot, like a pet pig on a ranch. No,”
he went on, addressing Clay, “I’ve looked in the
prow hold, and everywhere else I could think of,
and the extra anchor is not in view. I wish I had
by the neck the rascal who cut away the one we were
using.”</p>

<p>“Why do you want the anchor?” demanded Clay. “Do
you think the boat will float straight up in the
rain? We can find the mud hook in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Use one of your own jokes to weigh the <i>Rambler</i>
down,” advised Alex tucked up in his bunk. “They’re
heavy enough to weigh an ocean steamer down.”</p>

<p>Case removed Alex from his bunk, all bundled up in
blankets, and rolled him about on the floor, not as
a punishment for a too personal suggestion, he
explained, but for the good of his digestion. Teddy
assisted in the manipulation of the lad, and
Captain Joe actually laughed.</p>

<p>“When you’ve finished with that monkeyshining,”
Clay said, “perhaps you’ll tell me why you want the
anchor.”</p>

<p>“Just you go out and look,” was all the answer Case
made.</p>

<p>Clay did not go out and look, for it was raining
steadily, and he would have been wet to the skin in
a minute, but he went to the door and looked out.
The little valley of the rivulet was a brimming
ocean of angry water, and the natural levee which
separated it from the Columbia was out of sight. In
fact, there was a current running over it!</p>

<p>The <i>Rambler</i>, weighed down to some extent by the
iron wheels which had been put on the afternoon
before for the purpose of running her over the
shore to the smooth water below the rapids, was
still in what had been the sheltered pool, but the
boat had floated, and the wheels were fast against
the levee.</p>

<p>Whenever the water should lift the boat so that the
wheels would clear the levee, then the <i>Rambler</i>
would drift out into the raging stream, and the
experience of the previous night would be
re-enacted, with a different result in prospect. It
was another trying situation.</p>

<p>“How in the dickens did this valley get so full of
water, all at once?” he asked, turning back to the
cabin. “This is serious!”</p>

<p>“There must have been a cloudburst on the
mountain,” Alex suggested, arising and looking out
at the yellow sweep of water, now far above the
spot on the bank where the cooking fire had been
built “Looks like another flood.”</p>

<p>“There is no soil here to catch and hold the
downpour,” Case explained, “and this valley drains
a lot of country, which seems to be mostly standing
on end. The result is that a heavy rain here will
send a lot of water into this depression, and there
you are!”</p>

<p>“And it will send the <i>Rambler</i> over the rapids!”
Alex exclaimed, “if we sit around here and wait for
it to raise a few feet more.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what we can do, I’m sure,” Case said,
dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the river will rise so we can shoot the
rapids,” Alex suggested. “That would be easier than
rolling the boat around. I don’t feel no
nourishment in treating a boat like a wheelbarrow.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we might do that?” asked Case,
turning to Clay.</p>

<p>“We can tell by looking,” was the reply. “This
whole valley is a larger repetition of the little
one the rivulet fills to the brim every time it
rains. For a hundred miles, here, the valley of the
Columbia is narrow, with mountains on either side.
The rain, comes off the slopes in sheets, and there
is no reason why the Columbia should not rise six
or eight feet during a storm like this.”</p>

<p>“If it does, shall we risk it?” asked Case.</p>

<p>“I vote for risking it!” Alex shouted. “What’s the
use of going for a boat ride and then trundling the
old thing along on wheels?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Clay said, to change the subject, “all we
can do now is to get out a long, strong rope and
tie up to one of the cedar trees. Who’ll swim out
with it? It will be like taking a morning bath!”</p>

<p>“I will!” Alex replied. “I want a good swim,
anyway. I’ll put on an old suit, so I won’t get
scratched if I go to the bottom over a nest of
briars, and carry the rope to that big tree near
where we built the cooking fire. The rope will hold
the <i>Rambler</i> all right, will it?”</p>

<p>“It certainly will,” Clay responded. “There is
nothing to fear from the rope, but you must be
careful and not get into the current that is
sweeping out into the river. No one could swim
against that.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful, all right!” grinned the boy. “I
don’t want to do any long-diving stunts here. If I
should go under out there I might not come up until
I reached the ocean, which would be too long
without food.”</p>

<p>The boy put on an old suit which water and mud
would not injure and, taking a light cord, fastened
it about his neck and leaped into the swift-running
water. He had little difficulty in swimming
straight to the tree and, drawing the rope to him
by means of the cord, secured the boat to the great
cedar by the heavy cable. Then he turned back.</p>

<p>The lights from the boat lighted up the pool, or
what had been the pool, and Case and Clay could see
the boy sporting about in the water, now trying to
mount a log which the current was carrying down,
now dodging out of the way of a mass of boughs
which obstructed his passage.</p>

<p>“There’s something floating down that looks like a
paper!” he finally cried, “and I’m going to get it.
Just watch me, will you?”</p>

<p>He struck out into the swift drive of the rivulet
and swam boldly for a few strokes, missing the
paper at first, but finally overtaking it. When he
turned back the boys could see that he was in
distress. He was swimming with all his strength,
but he was being carried out. The sweep of the tide
was too strong for him.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine thing!” Case shouted. “Turn in, kid!
Turn in to the bank! Don’t try to swim against the
current. Turn in!”</p>

<p>Alex did turn toward the bank, but the water swept
him on, and he passed the <i>Rambler</i> with a white
face showing under the lights.</p>

<p>“What can we do?” asked Clay, half crazy at the
situation. “We can’t do a thing! The ropes are all
attached to the tree. Alex,” he called, “try to
turn toward the shore! You can’t swim against the
whole river! Face the other way, down stream, and
point for the shore!”</p>

<p>There was now a roaring in the boy’s ears, and the
water seemed a desirable place to rest! After he
had lain inactive a moment he would have the
strength to swim out! Many a tired swimmer has been
deceived by the same ideas that came to Alex—and
never came out again except by the aid of human
hands!</p>

<p>The despairing boy saw the cascade just ahead and
knew that, once over the falls made by the
natural levee, he would be in the open river and beyond
assistance. Still he swam, desperately, putting out
his last ounce of strength. The lights from the
boat did not shine brightly where he now was, and
the turbulent river beyond looked dark and cold.</p>

<p>Then a white body struck against his back, there
was a pull at his neck, and he knew that, slowly,
surely, he was winning against the current. He
realized that Captain Joe was holding him by the
shoulder and, while half supporting him, swimming
for dear life!</p>

<p>The boys on the <i>Rambler</i> watched the struggle
helplessly. Captain Joe was doing more than either
of them could have done. Now the swimmers gained a
trifle, now they were swept nearer to where the
flood tumbled over the levee. Captain Joe naturally
drew toward the shore, and this at last brought
them to safety.</p>

<p>After a long pull they came to a portion of the
levee where heavy shrubs still resisted the rush of
the water, and Alex grasped them and, after
breathing for a minute, worked his way to the
shore, Captain Joe still clinging to him, for the
dog was well-nigh exhausted. Clay and Case set up
great shouts when the two started up the bank of
the swollen pool.</p>

<p>They would still have to swim to gain the <i>Rambler</i>,
but this was not at all risky, as there was little
current between the bank and the boat.
Indeed, if Alex had kept to this part of the
expanse of water instead of swimming out into the
current after the paper, he would have had no
trouble in returning, and Captain Joe would have
had no opportunity to show both his loyalty and his
intelligence.</p>

<p>When the two clambered up on the deck of the
<i>Rambler</i> they met with a reception which disclosed
the affection that existed between the boys. They
shook Alex by the hands, and the shoulders, and
called him “a great dunce” for swimming out into
the current, and then shook hands all over with him
again! And Captain Joe was petted and fondled to
his heart’s content. Even Teddy, the bear, threw
his short arms about the neck of the big white
bulldog and gave him a hug!</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever think he doesn’t know all about
it!” Clay explained. “Teddy was just as anxious as
any of us, and I thought I heard him scolding when
you struck out into the middle of the flood.
Captain Joe was positively disgusted then!”</p>

<p>“Was it hard to get him into the water?” asked
Alex.</p>

<p>“Hard to get him into the water!” cried Case. “Why,
he was in before we knew anything about his
intentions. That is some dog!”</p>

<p>Rain was still falling, and the boys decided to
build a great fire in the coal heater and sit by it
until morning. Should the river continue to rise,
they thought, they would make the attempt to ran
the rapids.</p>

<p>“The high point won’t come until this water has had
time to get into the river and swell it opposite
this point,” Clay explained, “but we may as well
sit up as to go to bed and lie awake thinking what
a confounded numskull Alex is. Still,” he added,
“we should have missed the little rascal. I’m
strong for a medal for Captain Joe!”</p>

<p>It rained steadily all night, and when daylight
came it was only a blur, for the clouds were heavy
and low, and the rain seemed to fill all space. The
river was up to the top of the levee, and the
<i>Rambler</i> was pulling at the cable fastened to the
cedar. The valley, so far as they could see, was a
moving flood of yellowish water.</p>

<p>“If this keeps up until noon,” Clay said, “I’ll be
inclined to take a jump at the rapids. What do you
say, lads? Of course we’d have to take the wheels.</p>

<p>“I’m for it!” cried Alex and Case, in a breath.
“Lead us to it!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXVIII'>CHAPTER XVIII.—CASE MAKES A HIT WITH DOUGH.</h2>

<p class='first'>“The river is running like a mill-race,” Case
declared, at noon, as he looked over the surging
mass to the east of the spot where the <i>Rambler</i>
lay, “and the rain is stopping, so I don’t think it
will get any higher. Shall we set the motors going
and try to run down? I’m getting weary of staying
here.”</p>

<p>“You may wish yourself back a good many times
before we pass the rapids,” Alex said. “If you
think it’s any fun to breast a strong current, just
jump in there and try it. Then you’ll see!”</p>

<p>“I’m not curious about high currents,” grinned
Case, taking a glass and looking down the river.
The <i>Rambler</i> lay above the fringe of stunted
bushes which had hidden the pool on their approach,
and so the boy could look a long way down the
stream.</p>

<p>“I can’t see a single rock sticking up,” he said,
presently. “The current sets toward the other
shore, and looks safe, but it is making an awful
noise! It must be ten feet above yesterday’s mark.
Let us get ready.”</p>

<p>“I’m for getting dinner first,” Alex interrupted “I
don’t want to fill up on river water! We can fry
some of the bear meat, and get up quite a meal in a
short time. I like bear better in a stew, but we’ll
have to be content with fried meat this time.”</p>

<p>“Both the bears we have met were in a stew!” joked
Case.</p>

<p>“And they had us in the stew with them, too,” Alex
replied.</p>

<p>So the boys cooked bear meat, made biscuits out of
flour and baking powder, and ate dinner. Then they
washed and put away the dishes and got ready for
the exciting run ahead of them.</p>

<p>“We don’t know what is below the rapids,” Clay
suggested, as the boat under full power, shot out
of the pool and took the center of the stream, “but
we’re likely to find out right soon. Keep by the
motors. Case, to see that nothing goes wrong with
them, and you, Alex stand by the prow with your
pole, and we’ll break the speed record for motor
boats of our class. It doesn’t make any difference
how fast we go here if we don’t strike
obstructions. We’ll be through all the quicker.”</p>

<p>The boys were agreeably surprised at the ease with
which the journey through the rapids was made. The
<i>Rambler</i> rocked frightfully, at times, but the
high speed at which she was going kept her in
fairly good water, under the influence of the helm.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes she lay in a basin below the
cataract. The water ran swiftly in the basin, of
course, for the great mass above was forcing it on,
but there were no obstructions and no dangerous
eddies.</p>

<p>The whole valley to left and right appeared to be
under water clear up to the foot of the hills. The
boat was kept under motion until the light began to
die out, and then tied up to a tree in a dell which
had been dry only the day before.</p>

<p>“Now,” Case said, switching on the lights in the
cabin, “I’m going to celebrate the escape of
Hairbrained Alex by making a batch of bread. Real
bread, I mean, of hops and white flour. If I eat
any more pancakes I’ll be as flat, mentally, as
they are physically.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe even the bear or the dog will eat
bread you make,” said Alex, “but you might make
some. We may be able to use it for an anchor. Go
ahead, Case, and I’ll catch a fish for supper.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your oven?” asked Clay. “We can bake
biscuit under a pan on top of the coal stove, but
there are no pans on board the right size to fit
over a couple of loaves of bread. They are too
large or too small. We neglected to buy an oven.”</p>

<p>“There’s a granite iron pail here,” Case laughed,
“that will fit down tight over the bread on top of
the heater. I’ll mix up the dough, and we’ll have
it all ready to bake before we go to bed. I’ve seen
bread made lots of times, so I guess I can do the
trick.”</p>

<p>He took four packages of compressed yeast and put
them in a cup to dissolve, first heating the water
to blood temperature. Alex watched him with a grin
on his face.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you put in some yeast?” he finally
asked.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’m doing,” Case replied, “and
I’ll get along just as well if you go and get that
fish. We’ll want him for supper.”</p>

<p>Alex snorted and went away, pulling the bear cub
along with him. Captain Joe still stood watching
the making of the bread.</p>

<p>When the yeast was dissolved, Case emptied a large
quantity of flour into a great dishpan and stirred
the yeasty water into it Clay, who entered the
cabin at that stage of the proceedings, hastened to
ask:</p>

<p>“How much bread are you thinking of making, little
cook?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind me!” retorted Case. “I’m making
this bread. You don’t have to eat any of it. Go on,
now, and leave me alone. Ships’ cooks are never
questioned by the officers or the passengers.”</p>

<p>Clay went out to help Alex catch his fish, and Case
mixed the dough up lightly, making almost a
panful. This done, he switched on the electric stove,
placed a square pan, inverted, over the cherry-red
coils, laid a board over that, and set the pan of
dough on to “rise.”</p>

<p>“That ought to be up so we can bake it to-night,”
he thought. “I’d have made bread before if I had
known how easy it was.”</p>

<p>“What do you do next?” asked Clay, standing in the
door of the cabin.</p>

<p>“After it rises,” Case answered, not a little
proudly, “you mix it up good and hard and put it to
bake. We ought to have bread enough out of that
batch to last us a week. I can bake only two loaves
at a time under the pail, but time doesn’t count
for anything with us, and the dough will keep.”</p>

<p>The rain had stopped, and the boy went out on deck
to see how Alex was succeeding in his quest for a
fish supper. Conditions seemed to be wrong, for the
boy had not had a single bite.</p>

<p>After a time the lads decided to open beans and
make a supper of them, with pieces of fried meat
which had been left from dinner. Case brought the
beans and meat out on deck, under the prow light,
and they soon satisfied their hunger.</p>

<p>The boys sat out on deck for a long time, and then
Case went in and switched off the electric stove.
Teddy sat there watching the dough lifting in the
pan, and the boy left him there, thinking that he
would soon crawl into one of the bunks and go to
sleep. Then Case went out where the other boys sat
looking over the rushing water.</p>

<p>“That dough is coming along fine,” he exclaimed,
proud of his achievement, “and will be ready to mix
with more flour before long. I don’t see why women
make such a fuss over baking. It is just as easy as
mixing pancakes. We’ll have plenty of bread now.
I’ll make it often.”</p>

<p>The clouds slipped away and the stars looked down.
The strong electric light on the prow showed
wreckage of all kinds drifting past There were
trunks and limbs of trees, some green, as if the
water had undermined the roots of live cedars.</p>

<p>While they sat there, laying plans for the future,
something which looked like a battered rowboat came
sailing down. It surely was a rowboat, they
discovered, as it came nearer, and Clay took up the
glass and waited for it to come into the circle of
light.</p>

<p>“Boys!” he cried, as the wreck flashed into view
and then disappeared down the river, “I believe
that was what is left of our boat. It looked like
it, anyway! Now, how could that come here?”</p>

<p>“Caught in the flood,” Alex said, grimly. “I don’t
wonder that it is a wreck in that case. I’m a good
deal of a wreck myself to-night.”</p>

<p>“The last time we saw the boat,” Case remembered,
“it passed us, and Gran was riding in it, and a
long-armed man was rowing like mad. It ought to be
below us. I wonder if they were tipped into the
river when the boat was crushed.”</p>

<p>“Sure it was our boat?” he asked. “It doesn’t seem
possible.”</p>

<p>“It was the wreck of our boat,” Clay insisted.
“Well, it is only one more mystery for us to
forget. I wish Gran was here to-night.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” cried Case. “He’d be tickled half to
death to get some of my bread!”</p>

<p>“I hope the poor boy isn’t lying at the bottom of
the river, somewhere, or drifting in this yellow
flood,” Clay said. “I would give a great deal to
know why he left us.”</p>

<p>“He tried to tell us something in that paper,” Alex
cut in. “I wish he had had more time to write. I
guess that long-armed chap just grabbed him and
started away. We’ll catch up with him yet, if he
isn’t dead.”</p>

<p>The boys talked for a long time, Captain Joe
snoring at their feet and Teddy somewhere in the
cabin. They would have been on their way that
night, only they were entirely ignorant of the
character of the river below them. There might be
more dangerous rapids close at hand.</p>

<p>“Case,” Clay said, at length, “why don’t you go in
and look at your bread? You turned off the heat,
and it will be getting cold. Then we won’t have any
bread—which would be a shame.”</p>

<p>“I clear forgot about it,” Case answered. “HI go
right in and look after it. It won’t get cold, for
the pan under it and the board and the stove are
warm, or were when I switched off the electricity.
Guess I’ll mix it now. It must be about time.
Who’ll stay up and help me bake it?”</p>

<p>“I will!” answered Alex. “I’m just hungry for
bread.”</p>

<p>Case went into the cabin and turned on the lights.
The first thing he saw was a great heap of what
seemed to be snow banked high against the table
where the electric stove stood. But it was not
banked up so securely that it was not pushing out
over the floor.</p>

<p>Then he saw that the pan of dough had “risen,” and
that it was dripping down over the stove, over the
table, and over the floor. It seemed to the amazed
and disgusted boy that there was a barrel of it on
the table and another barrel on the floor. It
looked as if a spring of dough had bubbled up out
of the pan and started to make a dough pond of the
cabin.</p>

<p>Clay and Alex heard him trying to gather the dough
off the table, and stepped into the cabin. They
took one look and fell down on the floor, screaming
with laughter. Case turned angrily away.</p>

<p>“You seem to think it funny!” he said.</p>

<p>“Funniest thing I ever saw!” roared Alex. “What
are you going to do with all that stuff?
You’ve got enough there to feed a bread line. Oh, my!
Oh, my!” and he rocked back and forth and shouted.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get this pile on the floor out into
the river,” Case answered, beginning to see the
humor of the situation. “That in the pan is clean
and all right, and will make splendid bread.”</p>

<p>He took a broom and began pushing the mess on the
floor toward the door, but it was too sticky. After
the second muscular exertion in that direction he
stopped and leaned heavily on the broom.</p>

<p>The white heap was lifting straight up in the air.</p>

<p>“Glory be!” shouted Alex. “If it isn’t rising yet.
Lookout, or it will push the roof off the cabin!
Look at it! Look at it rise!”</p>

<p>The dough continued to move. It shunted this way
and that, then actually sprang toward the boy, who
leaped back in amazement.</p>

<p>“It is chasing him!” chuckled Alex. “The white
ghost of the bread that never was is chasing Case!
Oh, hold me, some one! He’d have made bread before
if he had known how easy it was! Oh! Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>The next moment it <i>was</i> chasing Case!
Teddy, struggling under the sticky stuff, got to
his feet and moved toward the door, trailing dough
after himself in great stringy masses.</p>

<p>Case sat down on the edge of the table and roared.
Clay hastened outside to have his laugh out, and
Alex just rolled on the floor, connecting with the
dough in more places than one and looking, when he
arose, like a baker who had slept in his mixing
trough.</p>

<p>“I told you to put a little yeast in!” cried Alex.
“I guess you did it, all right. Now, you’ll have a
time giving Teddy a bath I Why not put him in the
oven and bake him? We’ll have lots of bread now!
Wow! Wow!”</p>

<p>Case chased Alex out of the cabin and set to work
cleaning the bear. It was a thankless task, for
Teddy resented his efforts, and seemed to be
complaining that a cub couldn’t even go to sleep
under the electric stove without having his fine
bearskin coat all mussed up!</p>

<p>After the boy had done his best Alex turned in and
assisted in the further work of preparing what
dough was left for the oven. He chuckled to himself
all the evening, and talked knowingly to Teddy when
that abused little bear came to him for sympathy.</p>

<p>“When you see a printer making bread,” he
instructed the bear, as he washed flour and yeast
out of his eyes, “you want to climb a tree. Case
means well, but he knows about as much of the
manufacture of bread as you do of the Federal
constitution! Next time you see him melting up
yeast, you take to the woods. It will be safer
there!”</p>

<p>But, in spite of this sarcasm, Case stuck to his job
until the bread was baking under the granite
iron pail on the heater. As luck would have it, his
efforts proved successful, and the lads had hot
bread and butter before they went to bed.</p>

<p>There was little need, they thought, of keeping
watch that night, for the <i>Rambler</i> was tied up
quite a distance from the river, in four feet of
water, which was flowing over a piece of ground
which had been dry not long before. They were out
of sight from the center of the stream, and no one
would be likely to wade or swim through the
inundated country to get to them.</p>

<p>In the morning when they awoke the sun was shining
above the valley of the Columbia and it was late.
They paid little attention to the hour, however,
for they were in no hurry now, and, besides, there
was something more important for them to consider.</p>

<p>This was how to get the <i>Rambler</i> back into the
river! During the night the water had run out and
left them stranded!</p>

<p>“Tell you what we’ll do,” suggested Alex. “We’ll
have Case make some more dough, and that will raise
the boat up so we can slide her in!”</p>

<p>“All right,” Case declared, “have all the fun you
can, but you won’t get any more of that bread.
Teddy and Joe ate it up after we went to sleep.”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXIX'>CHAPTER XIX.—WHY THERE WAS NO VENISON.</h2>

<p class='first'>A golden morning followed the day of storm. A
golden morning on the Columbia river! Still, the
lads were in no mood to enjoy the beauties of
Nature as shown in her wilder moods. The <i>Rambler</i>,
as has been said, was stuck fast in the mud, some
distance from the ever-receding water.</p>

<p>“The rocks are showing again,” Alex observed,
looking down the river with the glasses, “and it
looks as if there were falls ahead.”</p>

<p>“The Columbia river,” Case grumbled, “seems to me
to be pretty sudden. She climbs up a couple of rods
one day and drops down the next. I wish she’d kept
up until we got through this valley.”</p>

<p>“That’s all the fun of it!” Alex insisted. “If you
want to live a life of idle pleasure, just you go
and get into a scow on a country mill-pond. We came
out here for adventures, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“From the looks of things,” Case continued, “we
ought to have brought a house-moving machine
with us. How are we ever going to get this
boat back into the river. We might hunt and fish
here until another flood comes along,” he added
with sarcasm in his tone.</p>

<p>“That would suit me, all right,” Alex returned. “I
don’t care how long we remain here. There’s plenty
of game in the woods, and, now that you have
learned to make bread, we are not likely to starve
to death.”</p>

<p>Clay who had been roaming around in the sticky soil
which the river had deposited on the inundated
lands, now came rushing up to the boat.</p>

<p>“Get out the rifle!” he said, speaking softly to
Case. “There’s a fine deer back there in the
thicket. We’ll have venison for dinner.”</p>

<p>All was excitement in a moment. Case brought out
the magazine rifle, and all three started for the
thicket where Clay had seen the deer. Captain Joe
was left in the cabin, with instructions to devour
any stranger who should try to scrape his
acquaintance.</p>

<p>The boys walked cautiously for a short distance,
then Clay stopped and pointed to a dense growth of
bushes and brambles just ahead. Out of the tangle
lifted the head of a deer.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t she run?” asked Alex in a whisper.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to know,” Clay replied. “She
stood just like that when I went away to get the
rifle. She must have heard me working my way
through the undergrowth. Maybe she’s dead—killed
standing!”</p>

<p>“Dead!” Alex grinned. “Don’t you see her move her
head? There, she’s pulled it down now, so there’s
nothing to be seen of her. Did you ever see
handsomer eyes in a creature’s head?” he added.</p>

<p>“Looked like she was asking us to come and help
her,” Case declared.</p>

<p>“I noticed that,” Clay mentioned. “I wonder what is
the matter with her. I’m going in there to see.
Keep still, you fellows.”</p>

<p>Clay crawled through the thicket on his hands and
knees, parting the bushes right and left, and
making as little noise as possible. Directly he
lifted a hand out of the undergrowth and motioned
for Case and Alex to follow him. The deer had again
raised her head above the tangle and stood looking
at the boys with pleading eyes.</p>

<p>“Never saw anything like that!” Alex muttered as he
made his way through the bushes. “I never knew a
deer could look a fellow in the face that way. I
though they’d run away. Maybe she’s hurt.”</p>

<p>When they came up to where Clay lay in the thicket
they found the deer only a few feet away, standing
over something lying on the ground.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t she run?” asked Case. “What kind of a
deer is that? She must be foolish in the head most
of the time.”</p>

<p>“Slang! You’ll wash dishes!” declared Alex.</p>

<p>“No slang about it,” reiterated Case. “That’s just
plain talk.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you see what the trouble is?” asked Clay.
“There is a young fawn there, caught in the briars,
and the mother won’t leave it.”</p>

<p>“I can see it now!” Alex cried. “Pretty little
thing!”</p>

<p>“That will make good eating, too,” Clay observed,
turning his face away as he spoke. “Come, now,
who’s going to shoot first? Better shoot to kill,
for the deer may run away when she hears the
report.”</p>

<p>Case and Alex looked at each other an instant and
then sat down on the ground and watched Clay, who
was still looking the other way.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I want any venison,” Alex
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I never did like venison!” was Case’s comment on
the situation.</p>

<p>Clay turned and looked his chums over in mock
anger.</p>

<p>“Just when I find a deer for you!” he cried. “Just
when you’ve got a chance you may never have again,
you go and back out. What’s the matter with you
boys? Think the deer is not fit for food?”</p>

<p>“I’ve lost my appetite for venison, that’s all,”
Case explained. “You can shoot if you want to.
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo, deer!”</p>

<p>He arose and waved his hands at the animal,
shouting at the top of his voice. The deer stepped
away a few paces but came back at the bleat of the
fawn. Clay regarded the boy with an amused smile.</p>

<p>“You tell me I can shoot, and then you go and scare
her away,” he complained. “What is getting into you
boys?”</p>

<p>“Did you see her eyes?” asked Alex. “If you shoot
her we’ll leave you here in the wilderness. I’m
going to see what’s the matter with the little
fawn. Is this the time of year for fawns?”</p>

<p>The other boys answered that they did not know, and
Alex said that he didn’t think it was. But there
was the fawn, with the mother watching over it,
whether it was the baby deer season or not. The
deer bounded away as Alex approached, but stood
watching as he lifted the fawn.</p>

<p>“Just got wound up in vines!” the boy cried. “Come
and see what a clever little chap it is! Wish I
could keep it.”</p>

<p>“Nix! Not on our boat! Not with the mother looking
at us like that!” declared Case, who had stepped up
to the fawn.</p>

<p>The little creature was soon untangled, and set
down in a clear space as near to the mother as the
boys could get. The deer did not seem to fear the
boys, for she stood nosing over the baby for a long
time. Then she led him away into the forest. Clay
insists to this day that she bowed her thanks as
the bushes closed behind her!</p>

<p>“There!” Clay shouted, in pretended anger. “You’ve
gone and let many a supper get away from us. What
do you mean by letting that deer run away in that
manner? You’re nice fellows to go hunting with!”</p>

<p>“Run after her and murder her if you want to,” Alex
remarked. “The woods are open to you, and you have
the rifle. Go on and do it!”</p>

<p>Clay laughed in a bashful manner. Someway boys
never do like to let others know that they are
possessed of sentiment!</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t shoot that deer, not if I was
starving!” he said. “I would always see her eyes
looking out of the shade at me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever think I didn’t know that!” Alex
answered. “I guess we are a lot of babies, after
all. Now we’ll have to eat bear meat for dinner, I
can eat bear, for the bear would have eaten us if
he had had half a chance. But the next thing is to
get the <i>Rambler</i> into the river. That won’t be no
merry picnic, I can tell you. Wish we had left her in.”</p>

<p>The boys made the boat as light as possible
and then worked her along with handspikes cut from
the woods. It was slow work, and many a time they
stopped to breathe and joke over the job. Alex
finally suggested that they put the wheels under
and so make easier work of it.</p>

<p>“In this muck!” laughed Clay. “Why, those wheels
would sink into this mess up to the hubs, and we
should never be able to move them. No, we’ve just
got to nudge her along in this way until we get to
the slope that leads down to the river, and then
she’ll go easier.”</p>

<p>It was noon before the prow dropped into the water.
The boys were tired and disgusted, but they had
been taught a lesson which they did not soon
forget. They were lifted to banks by floods after
that, but they did not permit the <i>Rambler</i> to lie
there until the current ran out from under her!
After dinner they started the motors again and
speeded down stream.</p>

<p>The country was still wild on both sides of the
Columbia, and the boys took plenty of time passing
through it. There were many things to see and,
besides, they still had half-hearted hopes that
Gran would come back to them before they left that
valley.</p>

<p>But Gran never showed up. The last thing they had
seen that reminded them of him—aside from the
half-conscious remembrance of the boy that was
always in their minds—was the wreck of the rowboat
which had drifted down the river during that day of
the flood.</p>

<p>It was a week before they came to the great bend of
the Columbia. Here they found stores and traders’
houses. They camped out on the batik of Canoe river
and remained there two days, laying in provisions
and getting acquainted with the people. During
their stay there many came to look over the
<i>Rambler</i>, and every one lifted brows in disbelief
when told that the beat had found her way through
the two long and dangerous rapids which lay above.</p>

<p>The boys made no attempt to remove the disbelief
from their minds. It really did look like a pretty
stiff yarn, so they let it go, loaded in their
purchases, and turned the boat south on the great
river, about two hundred miles above Upper Arrow
lake.</p>

<p>At Boat Encampment the boys had asked, quietly, of
course, if any man answering the description of the
long-armed fellow who had appeared and disappeared
so suddenly had been seen thereabouts, but no one
seemed to have seen him, or to have seen a boy
answering Gran’s description. It was said that any
one passing the place would be certain to be
observed, so the boys sailed away with the notion
that the two were still up the river.</p>

<p>There followed a number of restful days on a smooth
river. There were rapids and falls, of course, but
nothing to bring the lads into peril of their
lives. They loitered along with the current,
stopping at night and often not starting on again
until the middle of the day.</p>

<p>The boys will never forget those golden days.
They fished and hunted, sat around roaring campfires at
night, slept in the warm sunshine when inclined,
and read stories of that wonderful land. There was
only one trouble over which they brooded.</p>

<p>Gran had disappeared. During the time he had shared
the cabin with the boys, since he had come to them
so mysteriously at the summit pass, he had endeared
himself to them all. Beside the loneliness they
felt at his sudden departure, there was always the
undefinable feeling that he might be in serious
trouble and expecting them to come to him.</p>

<p>“If we knew that he had left us voluntarily,” Clay
said, one day, “we might be able to drop him out of
our minds, but we don’t know that. In fact, it
seems to me that he was forced away.”</p>

<p>“But he wasn’t tied in the boat,” Alex argued. “I
guess he might have jumped out when he came to the
<i>Rambler</i>. We would have shot that long-armed
humbug to pieces if he had tried to stop him.”</p>

<p>“There are ways of forcing a fellow along besides
tying him up and carrying him off,” Clay replied.
“The man we saw him with may have some grip on him
which we do not understand. We’ll have to wait.”</p>

<p>“That old train robber!” cried Alex. “What kind of
a hold could he have on Gran? I just believe the
boy was afraid to stir when he passed the <i>Rambler</i>
that day. Wish I’d shot that big stiff!”</p>

<p>“Besides,” Clay went on. “Gran passed us that note.
It was hastily ended, as if he had been interrupted
in writing it. And when he threw it out into the
river he made sure that the man who was rowing did
not see the movement.”</p>

<p>“The sneaking hold-up man!” Case broke in, angrily.</p>

<p>“We don’t know anything about him,” Clay concluded.
“We have no proof that he assisted in robbing the
train. In fact, we know that he did not, for he was
on the train that carried us into Donald.”</p>

<p>“But he might have put up the job,” insisted Alex.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXX'>CHAPTER XX.—CAPTAIN JOE MAKES A DISCOVERY.</h2>

<p class='first'>And in this way all their discussions concerning
Gran and the mysterious man ended. There were no
signs to go by. They hadn’t a thing to point to as
an established fact in connection with the boy
except that he had come to them in trouble, had
been assisted, and had been grateful.</p>

<p>And there were no clues to connect the long-armed
man with any crime whatever. The boys knew that he
had not been present at the robbery of the train,
and that is all they did know about him, except
that he had followed on after them and either
coaxed or forced Gran to desert them.</p>

<p>The larceny of the films was still a mystery. No
one save a member of the party could have taken
them, they thought. No one except a member of the
party would have been likely to have opened the
kodak and taken the films out right there in the
cabin. An outsider, it was certain, would have
taken the kodak with him and opened it at some less
perilous time.</p>

<p>So far as the robbery was concerned, the boys had
believed that Gran had taken them. They had
held that opinion until the note had been fished out of
the river. The note had started in to say something
about the films. If he had stolen them he would not
be apt to talk or write about them to the boys.</p>

<p>But the great point in connection with the films
was this:</p>

<p>“Why had they been taken?” This question was more
important to their minds than the one which all had
asked at first: “How had they been taken?”</p>

<p>There was an indistinct notion in Alex’s mind that
he had seen dark faces behind those sitting in
front of the fire at the pass. He believed that he
had secured some fine pictures of the campers, as
he called them, and was of the opinion that if
other faces had peered out from the shelter of the
rocks just at the right moment they, too, would
have entered the photograph in distinguishable
positions.</p>

<p>Who were the men loitering back there in the
shadows? Were they the men who had held up the
train? And was this the reason why they could not
afford to have even one of their faces show in a
photograph taken at that spot, at that time?</p>

<p>They all believed that Gran could clear up a good
share of the mystery if he saw fit to do so. They
had believed all along that he would tell all he
knew about that night just as soon as he became
more intimate with them. But he had left, voluntarily
or by coercion, without referring to the matter except at
the end, when he had written the word “films” in
the note he had cast out on the river.</p>

<p>The boys talked little of the mystery which
surrounded the appearance and disappearance of
Granville, but they thought about it a lot.</p>

<p>It is not far from thirty miles, as the river runs,
from Boat Encampment to Gold creek, which flows
into the Columbia river about west of Glacier lake,
far up on the eastern ridge of the Rocky mountains.
Here the lads found themselves, one night, sitting
around a great fire on the northern bank of the
creek.</p>

<p>Gold creek has its source in the western heights of
the mountains running along on the west side of the
Columbia river during its course to the north. At
that point the two branches of the river are only
about thirty miles apart, but there is a high range
of mountains between the two currents. Gold creek
penetrates so far into the hills where it has its
source that a few miles farther to the east would
send its waters into the eastern branch of the
Columbia.</p>

<p>The boys were enjoying themselves that night.
Captain Joe and Teddy were out on the bank,
sporting about, chasing each other into the low
bushes which fringed the creek. The bear had become
so tame that it was not necessary to keep him tied.</p>

<p>In fact, Alex declared that he would follow them to
the end of the earth if they tried to get rid of him.
Captain Joe made much of the cub, and the boys
called it a happy family.</p>

<p>As they sat there by the campfire a long, faltering
call came from darkness to the east. The mountains
come close to the valley there, and Gold creek runs
fast. The voice they heard seemed to come from the
creek itself.</p>

<p>Captain Joe gave over playing with the bear and
darted away. The boys called to him to come back,
but he paid no attention to them. His conduct was
so unusual that all started up to ascertain the
cause of his disobedience. But before they were
fairly on their feet he was hidden in the darkness.
The astonished boys looked at each other in
silence.</p>

<p>Then Clay hastened back to the fire and threw on
more lightwood, sending the flames high up above
the bushes. He also hastened to switch on the
electrics on board the <i>Rambler</i>.</p>

<p>“There is some one in distress up there,” he
concluded, “and we’ll give them all the light
possible. Strange thing about Captain Joe.”</p>

<p>“He never did a thing like that before,” Case
commented.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’ll get into a mix-up with a bear,”
Alex observed.</p>

<p>“But that wasn’t a bear that called!” laughed Clay.
“That was a human voice, and it sounded as if the
one who called was about all in.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it sounded to me,” Case agreed.</p>

<p>“It may be the man who stole the boat and took Gran
off in it,” Alex suggested. “He may have started
across the mountains and become lost.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t be calling to us,” Case said, with a
superior smile. “He will be apt to stay away from
us! At least, I should think he would.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” commented Alex. “He wouldn’t know whose fire
it was, would he? He might think it some hunter’s
camp. Besides, I have a notion that he thinks we
were drowned when he cut the chain of the anchor.
No, he hasn’t any idea that we are here. I hope it
is him. Then we’ll get some news of Gran Listen!
There it comes again, and it is not very far away,
either. That weak voice never traveled far.”</p>

<p>The call was repeated again and again, and all the
boys left the fire and started off up the creek,
not forgetting to take their electrics and
automatics with them. There were stars in the sky,
but it was dark under the trees along the bed of
the creek.</p>

<p>When they were a few paces from the fire the voice
called again, faintly.</p>

<p>“Pretty close by!” Clay observed. “I wonder where
Captain Joe is? He ought to be showing up
somewhere. Hope the fellow, whoever he is, won’t
mistake him for a grizzly and shoot him. There’s
his voice now.”</p>

<p>Captain Joe was indeed close by, sending a long,
heavy call into the darkness. He seemed to be no
farther away than the one who had called for
assistance. The boys moved forward swiftly.</p>

<p>“He’s found the stranger!” Case exclaimed. “I know
by the sound of his voice that he has treed
something. Good old Captain Joe!”</p>

<p>Directly the dog came out of a thicket, leaped
joyfully about the feet of the boys, gave utterance
to low growls of satisfaction, and ran back into
the undergrowth, as if inviting the lads to follow
on and see what he had discovered. They were not
slow in accepting the invitation.</p>

<p>Clay was in the lead, his searchlight on the
ground. Presently he came to a little shelter made
of fresh boughs and stopped to investigate.</p>

<p>“That’s been built within a short time,” he
declared, as Case and Alex came up. “But where did
Captain Joe go so quickly?”</p>

<p>“He’s probably inside that hut,” Case replied. “He
ran that way.”</p>

<p>The next moment the dog peered out from under the
stacked up boughs, seeming to say to his friends
that he had found some one there.</p>

<p>“I guess he has, all right,” Clay said, when Alex
expressed this idea. “He has found a human being,
for there are empty tins about, as if some one had
eaten here. Come out, Captain Joe!”</p>

<p>But Captain Joe did not obey. Instead, he retreated
under the boughs and growled a further invitation
for them to come into his parlor!</p>

<p>Clay pushed his light farther and opened the
overhanging mass of foliage. What he saw inside was
a slender figure lying on a rough bed of leaves and
grass. At the side of the figure were several tins
of food which had not been opened. Captain Joe was
bending over the face, which lay in the shadow,
caressing it with his soft tongue.</p>

<p>Clay pushed the dog away and lowered his light.
Then the cry he uttered caused Case and Alex to
rush through the sheltering boughs and stand by his
side. In a moment all were on their knees at the
side of the figure, now lying with closed eyes.</p>

<p>“It is Gran!” Clay shouted. “It is Gran come back
to us!”</p>

<p>“He’s dead, I guess!” was Alex’s sad comment. Clay
bent forward and took the boy’s hand into his own.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “he is still alive. Now, how the Old
Harry did he ever get here? And what is the matter
with him?”</p>

<p>Case pointed silently to one leg, lying off the
rough bed. There were rude splints tied to it with
strips of cloth torn from the boy’s trousers. The
garment had been cut from the leg, and it could be
seen what the splints meant.</p>

<p>“He’s fallen and broken his leg!” Case exclaimed.
“Poor chap!”</p>

<p>“And he built this shelter to die in!” faltered
Alex. “I wonder if he will ever come back to
consciousness?”</p>

<p>The shelter had evidently been constructed by the
injured boy with the intention of resting for a
time after his bungling attempt at leg-setting. The
food he had brought there had been set out in
orderly array within reach of his arm as he lay on
his couch of foliage, and a dish of water—a
two-quart basin which forest travelers sometimes
use to cook in—sat not far away. An attempt had
been made to build a fire near the hut, but this
had not proved a success. Burned matches lay
around, but none of the dry sticks had caught fire.</p>

<p>“He was making a fight for life, all right, poor
little chap!” Clay said, wiping a suspicious
moisture from his eyes.</p>

<p>“I reckon he called to us with his last strength,”
Case muttered.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so!” Clay answered. “Well, how are we
going to get him to the boat without causing him
great suffering? He ought to be moved right away,
before he comes back to his senses.”</p>

<p>“I’ll run back to the <i>Rambler</i> and bring a long
board there is under one of the bunks,” Case
suggested. “Then we’ll carry him on that, just as
if it was a stretcher. We’ll give him his old bed
in the cabin, and when he comes to he’ll be so glad
to get back that he won’t know he’s got a broken
leg!”</p>

<p>The boy was away like a shot, and presently
returned with the board.</p>

<p>Gran was lifted gently on the improvised stretcher
and carried, as gently as the uneven nature of the
ground would permit, to the boat. He did not open
his eyes during the removal, and the boys became
frightened, fearing that he was indeed dead. Alex
hustled around and had water on the stove heating
in short order.</p>

<p>“He’s got to have hot water on that leg,” he said.
“I guess I can take that swelling down a little.
Now, do you think you can tell, either of you, how
bad the injury is, and whether the bone is
splintered or just broken short off?”</p>

<p>Clay cautiously applied a hand to the injured limb,
feeling on both sides of the splints. In a second
he looked up with a smile on his white face and
added more fuel to the fire so as to hasten the
heating of the water. Case and Alex looked at him
questioningly.</p>

<p>“The little hero set his leg himself,” Clay said.
“I don’t know how he ever did it! The bones are
back in place, and the flesh is not at all bruised.
The brave little chap! How did he ever do it?”</p>

<p>“He probably killed himself doing it,” wailed Alex.
“He fell down some precipice and crawled miles to a
spot where he could get wood for the splints.
Crawled miles with that broken leg and carried his
food with him! He’s a little hero, that’s just what
he is!”</p>

<p>There was no sleep for the boys that night. Gran,
worn out by suffering and over-exertion, lay until
daylight with his eyes closed.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXI'>CHAPTER XXI.—A CAMPFIRE HIGH ON THE HILLS.</h2>

<p class='first'>There was quite a celebration in the cabin when, at
last, just as the sun came into view over the
mountains, Gran opened his heavy eyes and looked
about. All three boys were at his side instantly,
and Captain Joe, who seemed to claim precedence by
right of discovery, put his great paws up on the
bunk and addressed soft phrases in dog talk to the
patient.</p>

<p>“For my sake don’t tell him that he mustn’t talk,
now!” Alex broke out. “Of all the chestnuts of
fiction that is the worst! Let him get his troubles
off his chest! Hello, Gran, old top! How are you?”
he added, wrinkling his freckled nose at the boy on
the bunk. “Brace up!”</p>

<p>“And don’t you dare to look wildly around and say,
‘Where am I?’” Case threatened, taking up the mood
of the first speaker. “That is another of the terms
kept standing in all printing offices. You’re
looking fine this morning, old man!” he continued,
determined to cheer the boy up to the point of a
smile if that were possible.</p>

<p>“What kind of a foolish house do you think we keep
here, Gran?” asked Clay. “These lads are doing a
lot of talking, but neither one has made a move to
get you something to eat. What will you have? Fish,
partridge, bear or baked beans? Apple pie, dried
apple pie, red apple pie, or pie-pie! Give a name
to it, and you’ll be feeding like a king in no time
at all!”</p>

<p>Gran laughed at the waiter-like tone and manner,
and tried to sit up, but was glad to lie down
again.</p>

<p>“I know where I am,” he said, “but I don’t know how
I came here. I guess the <i>Rambler</i> is going
somewhere, but I don’t know where.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know where you’re going, but you’re on
your way!” chanted Alex. “Well,” he continued,
“you’re going down the Columbia river, according to
schedule, and that is enough to know. That’s all
any of us know. We came around by Canoe river, and
you came across the mountains, and we beat you to
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I came across the mountains,” Gran said,
weakly, “and got a tumble, and had a fright of a
time getting down to the river valley. I saw your
lights and that’s about all.”</p>

<p>Not a word about why he had left the <i>Rambler</i>, or
where he had put in his time since then, or how the
rowboat had been obtained and, later, wrecked! Not
a word about the man in whose company he had last
been seen! Not a word about the missing films! Not
a word calculated to clear up any part of the
mystery!</p>

<p>“You did a good job setting that leg,” Clay said,
to break the awkward silence. “You must have had a
bad time doing it, too.”</p>

<p>“I did,” Gran confessed. “I had a wretched time. I
tied my foot to a tree, after I had the splints
bound lightly on, and dropped down a bank. I heard
the bones snap back into place, and knew that the
splints were holding them there, and went to sleep!</p>

<p>“It was a long time before I sensed any pain again.
Then I got back to a level spot and tightened the
splints. Are they still on?”</p>

<p>“Still on, and right as a book!” exclaimed Alex.
“You’re a brick!”</p>

<p>“That was after you got to the valley?” asked Clay.
“How far had you walked with that broken leg before
you found splints and mended it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know!” was the reply. “It seemed that
I was out days and days, and a bear came and sat by
me, and Captain Joe drove him off, and then I woke
up in the cabin of the good old <i>Rambler</i>!”</p>

<p>The boys exchanged significant glances. Was it true
that the dog had driven off a grizzly, or was the
boy telling what he saw after his brain had become
affected by suffering? They asked no questions, for
the boy’s eyes were closing, and they knew
that he needed rest more than they needed information. In a
minute the lad was resting easily.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” asked Alex as the three
boys stood out on the bank, Captain Joe capering
clumsily about them.</p>

<p>“What do I make of what?” demanded Case. “Talk
United States.”</p>

<p>“I guess you are sparring for time!” laughed Alex.
“So you don’t know what to make of it? You haven’t
a thought in your head?”</p>

<p>“That is the truth of it,” Case returned. “I don’t
know why Gran doesn’t say something about his
desertion of us. I have given up trying to think
that out, so we’ll build up more fire, get a bed of
coals, and broil bear steak for breakfast. I’m
getting hungry, and I guess Gran will need a little
sustenance when he wakes up. Say, wasn’t it a
blessing that we came along just as we did?
Otherwise, he would have died. Never could have
made his way out with that broken leg!”</p>

<p>While Clay and Case broiled bear steak and made
coffee Alex whistled to Captain Joe and started
away. Taking the course pursued the previous
evening, he soon came to the rough shelter which
the injured boy had prepared. There he sat down and
held a threatening finger up to the nose of the
white bulldog.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Captain Joe,” he said, gravely, “did
you find a bear here last night, and did you drive him
away? Tell me, quick, old fellow.”</p>

<p>The dog turned away with a sniff and circled around
the hut. Alex followed, soon coming upon claw
tracks in the earth. He turned to Joe.</p>

<p>“I believe you did!” he cried. “Now, if you please,
will you go show me where that bear is? I want a
short conversation with him. What?” Captain Joe
started off in the direction of the high ridges to
the east, and finally paused at the opening to a
deep cavern in a towering cliff. Alex looked in and
sniffed inquiringly, after which he backed out and
turned toward the campfire, Joe marching along at
his side.</p>

<p>“You’re a wonder, dog!” the boy exclaimed. “You’re
a wonder, and no mistake about it! I’ll have you
put in a book when we get back to Chi.” Captain did
not seem to take kindly to this proposition, for he
hastened back to the fire and lay down with his
nose cuddled between two rather dirty paws. Alex
came in in a moment and told what he had seen.</p>

<p>“I guess the dog did see a grizzly,” Clay decided,
“and drove him off. It is a wonder he didn’t get
his ears boxed!”</p>

<p>“Our lights probably had something to do with the
retreat of the big brute,” Case suggested. “I wish
we had found him there!”</p>

<p>Gran ate bear steak and drank coffee when he
awoke, and the boys loafed about the <i>Rambler</i> and made
merry. During the day the injured boy talked of
almost everything except the things in which his
chums were interested.</p>

<p>He told of some of his experiences in crossing the
mountains to the headwaters of Gold creek, but did
not say how he came to be in that wild region all
alone, nor why he had written the note saved from
the river. Naturally the boys were consumed with
curiosity, but they asked no questions, leaving the
solution of the problems to time and to future
moods of their patient. Gran’s leg mended fast, and
he was soon as full of fun as the others. Still no
hint of the reason for his disappearance!</p>

<p>All the boys enjoyed the leisurely progress down
the river which followed. They were often obliged
to work their way around falls and long, foaming
rapids, but they did the work cheerfully, and took
all the more comfort in smooth stretches of water
when they came to them. Below Gold creek the valley
widens to the west, and a high plateau presents a
vast area of growing timber. Only a short range of
mountains divides this fertile stretch of country
from the high plains drained by the Fraser river.</p>

<p>The boys tied up one night at Seymour creek which
flows into the Columbia from the west, about thirty
miles below Gold creek, and made a camp on shore.</p>

<p>“This,” Clay, said in the morning, “is one of the
finest timber sections in the world, and I’m not
going to run through it. Some day there will be
great farms here, with wheat growing luxuriantly
during the short season. Now there is plenty of
game, and I’m going to get some of it.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll take a trip to Sir Donald mountain,”
Alex said, pointing across the big river, where the
white cap of the peak shone in the sunlight. “I
want to see how the country looks from the roof.”</p>

<p>“You should have been with me on my excursion over
the mountains!” Gran remarked. “You’ll find it cold
up there, and you’ll find slippery rocks and
precipices which reach down into the bowels of the
earth!”</p>

<p>“I want to see things!” Alex exclaimed. “If I had
been looking for a peaceful life, I would have
rented a boat in Chicago and sat out in the South
Branch with it! Me for the high spots!”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go along with him,” Case observed. “I
want to see the high spots, too, and, besides, I
may be able to keep this rash youth from getting
treed by a grizzly again! He’s always getting into
trouble!”</p>

<p>Clay finally agreed to remain with Gran during the
day, and the two adventurous boys were landed on
the east side of the Columbia, not far from the
mouth of Six Mile creek, close to the foothills
which rise to the greater elevation of Sir Donald
mountain. It was early on a splendid morning in
early spring, and the boys felt the influence of
the time moving the blood swiftly in their veins.
Youth was in their every movement and the spirit of
adventure sung in their ears!</p>

<p>It was a long walk to the place where the mountain
asserted itself above the hills, and, a little over
half way there, the lads stopped, and sat down on a
rock to eat the sandwiches of bread and bear meat
which they had brought with them. Around them was a
rugged country, several hundred feet above sea
level.</p>

<p>Although the bulk of the mountain was still some
distance to the east, there were canyons and
lifting crags all about them. Just below, the thin
thread of Six Mile creek glistened in the light of
the morning. The springs which give rise to this
stream are far up in the mountains, and melting
snow has much to do with the quantity of its
waters.</p>

<p>“Straight east of where we are,” Case said, as they
ate their dinners, “are the rapids we had such a
time passing.”</p>

<p>“No,” Alex answered, looking at a map, “the rapids
are some miles to the north. Straight east of this
point is Beaver, where the Canadian Pacific turns
south toward Rogers pass and Glacier House.”</p>

<p>“Guess you are right,” Case admitted, looking over
Alex’s shoulder. “And just a little way to the
south is Donald, where we took to the river. Just
think of what a country this is! We have
traveled something like two or three hundred miles, as the
river runs, and yet we are not more than fifty
miles from where we launched the <i>Rambler</i>! What a
country this would be for outlaws to hide in! Train
robbers, for instance!”</p>

<p>“For all we know,” Alex replied, “the men who held
up the Canadian Pacific train, the men who have
been following us, so far as we can judge, may be
hiding in here! To tell you the truth, old chap,
that is one reason why I wanted to come here. Last
night, while looking over this way, I saw the smoke
of a campfire right about here. It was a big fire,
for it lighted up quite a space, and I could see
people moving about.”</p>

<p>“Shadows!” Case answered, scornfully. “You never
could see people in the night at this distance from
our camp.”</p>

<p>“Remember,” Alex insisted, “that they were high
above us, and that the fire shone on a face of rock
back of them. Remember, also, that the smoke went
straight up and gave me a good view of a blazing
fire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” Case decided, critically, “you might
have seen figures moving about. You had your glass,
of course?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Well, there were people camping over
here, and I thought I’d like to see what kind of
people they were. I said nothing to Clay about my
motive in coming here, because he thinks I’ll
be getting into trouble enough with peaks and canyons,
without hunting up mysterious camping parties in
the Rocky mountain district.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you didn’t mention it to him,” Case
mused. “He would have been anxious about us. Just
as if we aren’t big enough to take care of
ourselves. Have you seen the place where the fire
was yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the boy, “it is across this little
valley, up against the face of that rock. See, the
rock is smudged!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Case exclaimed, swiftly moving under cover,
“and there are smudgy looking men coming after us
with guns in their hands! Duck, partner!”</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXII'>CHAPTER XXII.—THE SURGEON TURNS DETECTIVE.</h2>

<p class='first'>Case dodged deeper into a rocky depression as he
spoke, and Alex was not slow in following him.
Three men, all carrying guns, were approaching from
the south, now in full view as they mounted an
elevation, now lost to sight as they dipped into a
canyon. The boys watched them furtively.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they saw us?” queried Alex shifting
about so as to look over a stunted shrub growing on
the edge of their hiding-place.</p>

<p>“I think not,” Case reasoned, “for they are headed
farther to the east. Looks like they were going up
the slope in search of game.”</p>

<p>“I just believe they are the train robbers!” Alex
exclaimed, in a moment. “You know, we were talking,
a short time ago, about what a cute little place
this would be for a fugitive to hide in.”</p>

<p>“And they may be hunters, or officers in quest of
the robbers,” Case amended. “Anyway, there’s their
camp, to the left of that crag, and we’ll work over
that way as they get farther off. If they did see
us, and are hoping to capture us, the safest thing
for us to do is to double back, like rabbits. Come
along!”</p>

<p>Keeping under cover of ridges, sneaking through
depressions in the broken surface, the boys moved
toward the spot indicated by Case. In a few moments
they saw that the three men were bearing farther
away to the north and east. This fact relieved
their minds of the suspense which the sight of the
advancing men had occasioned, and they made more
open progress.</p>

<p>Directly they came to the camp itself, and were
delighted to see that it was shut out of view from
the direction taken by the men by a rocky ledge.</p>

<p>It was a primitive camp, with boughs dragged up
from below serving as beds. The number of empty
food tins scattered about indicated that it had
been in use number of days.</p>

<p>A great coat, ragged and soiled, yet still valuable
in that exposed position because of its thickness
and evident warmth, lay on a rock near the embers
of a dying fire. After glancing carefully around to
see that they were still out of sight of the men,
Alex picked the garment up and began a search
through the pockets, still whole and mostly empty.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea they left their cards in there?”
grinned Case.</p>

<p>“Never can tell,” replied the other. “Sometimes
people leave things in pockets. Anyway there may be
a tailor’s label on the coat which will tell us
where it came from.”</p>

<p>He drew out a paper as he spoke and tossed it to
one side with the remark that they were saving up
fire-lighters.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t throw that newspaper away,” Case
protested. “Hand it here! It may show the town they
visited last. Calgary, date, eh?”</p>

<p>“How old is it?” asked Alex at once interested.
“When was it printed, I mean. That may tell us
something.”</p>

<p>“A week ago,” was the reply. “They must have
secured it at Donald or Beaver, for that matter. It
will be new to us, anyhow, whatever date it is. Not
much of a newspaper, after all, though.”</p>

<p>“Just don’t be in a hurry!” Alex suggested, as Case
laid the newspaper down on the ground. “There is a
marked item in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a few pencil marks,” Case admitted.
“Nothing to them.”</p>

<p>“It tells about the train robbers hiding in the
mountains,” Alex explained, reading over the
headlines. “And here’s another item under it.
Listen to this, will you?”</p>

<p>“‘Chicago, April 1,’” the boy read aloud. “‘An
unprovoked murder was committed on Wells street
late last night. Charles Stiven, employed as
barkeeper at a South Side saloon, was attacked by
Richard Miller, of the importing firm of Durand
Miller, and shot to death. The injured man did not
die on the street where the shooting took place,
but later expired at St. Joseph’s hospital, after
making a statement which is likely to hang Richard
Miller if he is caught. Miller escaped after the
shooting and had not been captured at the hour of
going to press. No reason is given for the brutal
attack.’”</p>

<p>“Rather old news, that,” Case remarked. “Why, we
were in Chicago when that affair took place.
Anything more about it?”</p>

<p>“Just a short description of Miller,” was the
reply. “It says he is unusually tall, with—”</p>

<p>The boy stopped and looked up at Case with a
question mark in each excited eye. Then he arose
and held the paper out so Case could read the
paragraph where his finger was placed. The boy did
so wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Unusually tall, with long arms,’” the boy read,
following Alex’s slowly moving finger. “Now, what
do you think of that, young fellow?”</p>

<p>“That’s the man that was on the train,” Alex declared.
“That’s the man Gran talked with in the cedars! That’s the
man who took Gran off in our rowboat! No wonder the
lad doesn’t want to say a word about his adventures
on the mountains. What can it all mean?”</p>

<p>“I’m going right back and show this to him!” Case
cried. “I’m going to know all about this. Gran’s
got to come through on this, as the police officers
say. Don’t you think that’s what we ought to do?”
he asked as the other looked grave and doubtful.</p>

<p>“We’ve trusted him so far,” Alex replied, “and I
see no reason why we should not continue to do so.
Besides, the boy is ill, and must not be excited.
But, look here, that man is undoubtedly still
around here somewhere. Why he sent the boy over the
mountains alone is more than I can say, but a man
who will commit an unprovoked murder is equal to
almost anything! We’d better get back to the
<i>Rambler</i>. He may try to get the boy away again.
We’ll look after this Mr. Richard Miller, all
right!”</p>

<p>“You just bet we will!” was the answer, and the
boys, forgetting, for the moment, the men whose
camp they had invaded, crept out of the tumbled
rocks and, once out of range of the three men on the
hills, hastened toward the <i>Rambler</i>. Half way
to the river, Alex paused.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the men we saw aren’t officers,
looking after this Miller person?” he asked.
“They’ve got the description of him, you know.”</p>

<p>“No they haven’t!” chuckled Case. “I brought it
away with me.”</p>

<p>“That was a foolish thing to do,” Alex protested.
“Now they will know that their camp has, been
visited. I reckon we’d better get the <i>Rambler</i>
under way just as soon as we get to it. If we don’t
they’ll find us and make trouble.”</p>

<p>Case agreed with this view of the matter, and, as
they stood on the east bank of the Columbia,
waiting for Clay to run across and get them, they
decided to tell him all about it and to advise an
immediate departure for Upper Arrow lake, where
Gran would, they thought, be safe.</p>

<p>Clay was not a little excited at the recital. He
agreed with the boys that they ought to leave at
once, and preparations for departure were
accordingly begun. Gran looked on indolently at
first, but finally called Clay to his side and
asked:</p>

<p>“Are you going to leave this section of country
now?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” was the guarded reply. “We want to get
to the Pacific before snow flies, and we have a
long way to go. Besides, we do not want to remain
too long in one place.”</p>

<p>“But you wanted to hunt over on the plateau, this
morning,” Gran urged. “And why did the boys come
back from the mountain so soon? Is there anything
wrong?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course not,” Clay answered. “Only we have
the moving-on spirit to-day. We’ll drop down to
Revelstoke and get a sight of the Canadian Pacific
right-of-way before night, or, at least, before
morning. That will connect us with civilization, at
least,” he added, with a grin.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the motion of the boat will hurt my
leg,” Gran urged, not looking Clay in the eyes. “I
want to get well as rapidly as possible, you know.
Can’t you wait a few days—wait here?”</p>

<p>“I’ll talk with the boys,” Clay promised and went
out. When he told them of the request Gran had
made, their eyes stuck out “good and plenty,” as he
afterwards expressed it. It was a puzzle to all of
them.</p>

<p>“But why should he want to stay here?” Case asked,
in amazement. “Why shouldn’t he want to get away
from a valley which must have unpleasant
recollections for him? He would have died in that
hut if we hadn’t happened along! And the man we’ve
been talking about brought him to it all by taking
him away from us. It is the strangest thing I ever
heard.”</p>

<p>“He went away with the man willingly,” Clay
explained, “at least we saw him make no attempt
to get away when we were close at hand, and might have
helped him. Now, how do we know that he is not
waiting in this valley to meet this man again? This
Richard Miller, who is wanted in Chicago for the
crime of murder. I suppose,” he added,
thoughtfully, “that there can be no doubt about the
description? The man described in the newspaper
article is the man we saw on the train, the man who
talked to Gran in the cedar canyon, the man who was
rowing when Gran passed down stream and flung the
note in the water?”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it,” Case asserted. “That is the
man—Richard Miller, the man wanted in Chicago to
answer to the crime of murder.”</p>

<p>“But, look here,” said Alex always ready to defend
Gran, “stop and think a minute! If Gran went with
this man willingly, why didn’t he stop long enough
to tell us he was going? Why didn’t he tell the man
to row up to the <i>Rambler</i> and let him explain? Why
was it necessary for him to put what he had to say
to us on paper, and then stop his writing in the
middle of a sentence. I don’t believe he left us
willingly.”</p>

<p>“One reason why the man—this Richard Miller—did not
let him come up to the <i>Rambler</i> was that he had
our rowboat—the boat which had been cut loose from
her chain the night before. Say,” he continued,
with a blush and a laugh, “I’m getting this mixed.
It was the anchor that he cut away,
and not the boat! At least, I think he did! He wouldn’t
want to come to close quarters with us after doing that,
would he?</p>

<p>“Well, he might as well have cut the boat loose,”
Clay said, “for he stole it after it had drifted
away. We saw him in it. That’s proof!”</p>

<p>“Well, what are we going to do about it?” asked
Case, turning to Clay.</p>

<p>“Let’s stay here and see it out!” Alex interposed.</p>

<p>“That suits me!” Clay answered. “I haven’t lost
confidence in Gran yet, and, besides, there’ll be
excitement in it, if what you boys say about the
men on the other side of the river is true—if they
are really train robbers. I think it will be fun to
see it out!”</p>

<p>And so it was agreed that they should follow the
wishes of the boy and remain where they were for a
time, although they all understood that the reason
given by the lad—that the motion of the boat might
affect his broken leg unfavorably—was not the true
one. But another surprise awaited Clay when he went
into the cabin to acquaint Gran of the decision
which had been reached. The boy was half sitting up
in his bunk with a flush on his cheeks which had
not been there before.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” he said, as Clay entered. “I
am beginning to think that my leg ought to have the
care of a surgeon. You boys are all anxious to be
on your way, and so why not drop down to
Revelstoke? I can endure the short journey, all
right, and we can remain there a few days until the
surgeon has had time to straighten me out.”</p>

<p>“We have all agreed to remain here,” Clay said,
with a smile, “but we can go on just as well as
not. We need a glimpse at a town.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to keep you here,” Gran went on.
“When I spoke about staying here I didn’t think I
would need the attention of a surgeon, but I begin
to feel that one ought to be consulted.”</p>

<p>When Clay went out to the others with this new
proposition they were more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p>“Why did he change his mind so suddenly?” was the
question Alex asked. “There’s something back of all
this. Do you think he heard us talking about the
train robbers?”</p>

<p>“He might,” answered Clay, and there the subject
was dropped.</p>

<p>That night, without mishap on the way, they tied up
at Revelstoke, which is a small town where the
Canadian Pacific takes to the valley of the
Columbia river again. They did not succeed in
finding a surgeon that night, the one located there
being away, neither did they spend any time about
town, for they thought it best to remain on the
boat with the injured boy.</p>

<p>The next morning Clay found the surgeon at his
office and sent him down to the <i>Rambler</i>, himself
remaining in a general store to purchase a few
luxuries for the lad. While there he heard
considerable talk about the chase after the train
robbers, who were thought to be in that section.</p>

<p>“I’d like to be the one to catch them,” he heard a
rough-looking man saying. “It would be worth
$10,000 to me. I need the money!”</p>

<p>“If I could only point them out,” another cut in,
“I would be satisfied. There’s a reward of $5,000
for just locating them.”</p>

<p>Clay left the store with the reward bee buzzing in
his cap. They were not plentifully supplied with
money, and a portion of that reward would be very
acceptable. And the three men in the mountains!
Perhaps they were the very men wanted by the
officers.</p>

<p>While he walked about, thinking the matter over,
the surgeon came into the one street of the place
and stopped him, rather bruskly, he thought. Clay
had an idea that it was his fee he wanted.</p>

<p>“Where did you pick up that boy?” the surgeon
asked.</p>

<p>“He came into the country with us,” Clay answered,
not very pleasantly, for he believed that the
surgeon was interfering with something that was
none of his business. He turned away, but the other
followed.</p>

<p>“You mean that he came from Laggan with you,” he
said.</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” demanded Clay, getting
angry.</p>

<p>“Well,” sneered the surgeon, “this boy’s
description is among those of the hold-up men. He,
or some one looking remarkably like him, was seen
on the pass, in the company of the men who are
believed to have held up the Canadian Pacific
train. I’m going now to notify an officer.”</p>

<p>Clay, for a moment, did not answer. What was there
he could say?</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXIII'>CHAPTER XXIII.—THE POLICEMAN MAKES A MISTAKE.</h2>

<p class='first'>“The boy was with us, in the <i>Rambler</i>, on a
platform car on a Canadian Pacific train, going
towards Donald, when the robbery took place,” Clay
explained, directly, trying hard to keep his temper
in the face of the impudence and greed shown by the
surgeon.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to prove that!” said the surgeon. “Why
are you boys hiding in that motor boat, anyway?
Have you been carrying supplies to the men who did
the actual work in the robbery? And there was some
one shot on a train leaving the pass, on the night
of the robbery. Was it a bullet that broke the
lad’s leg? You’d better be frank with me.”</p>

<p>“You ought to know whether the injury was caused by
a bullet or not,” replied Clay, beginning the story
of the trip down the Columbia and ending with the
finding of the boy in the shelter he had hastily
constructed.</p>

<p>During the recital, however, he said not a word
about the man who had so often presented himself to
their notice.</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” the surgeon said, “but it
only shows that the boy is mixed up in some secret
matter, even if you boys are not in the game with
him. Here comes DeYoung, the policeman, now, and
I’ll turn the matter over to him, but I want you
for a witness to prove that I found the boy and
pointed him out to the officer. I want that
reward.” “I thought so!” Clay replied, scornfully.
“That’s what you are working for! Well, you won’t
get it. I’ll attend to that!”</p>

<p>DeYoung, the policeman, now came up and held a
short conversation with the surgeon. Clay was not
permitted to hear what was being said, but at the
termination of the conference the policeman, a
member of the mounted force, approached him with a
scowl on his face.</p>

<p>“So you’ve been harboring a train robber, have
you?” he demanded. “I think I’ll take you all in
and hold you for identification. I’ll go to the
boat now and get the boy. Come along, doctor, and
assist.”</p>

<p>“But the boy mustn’t be moved! cried Clay, in
alarm.</p>

<p>“Oh, mustn’t he?” snarled the officer. “We’ll see
about that!”</p>

<p>“It will be all right to move him,” the surgeon
said.</p>

<p>“Of course! And I’ll see that the boys are kept
away from him, too.”</p>

<p>“It may be just as well to put them in separate
cells,” suggested the surgeon. “One of them may
confess, after going hungry a short time.”</p>

<p>Clay was angry enough to fight, but he knew that
such a course would be worse than useless. These
men had the power to do as they pleased until
higher officers were reached.</p>

<p>It will be understood, however, that he felt pretty
ugly at the idea of being parted from the injured
boy. That would be a great deal worse than having
the river trip interrupted and being locked up in a
Canadian prison, he thought.</p>

<p>He argued with the policeman and the surgeon to no
purpose. Their eyes were fixed on the reward. The
thought, the prospect, of receiving so great a sum
completely blinded their eyes to all sense of
justice and humanity. Clay resolved, then, that
they should both suffer for their brutality if they
removed the boy and locked them all up.</p>

<p>He thought of telling the policeman of the men who
had been hiding in the mountains. To his mind these
were the robbers. He believed that the officer
might gain the $10,000 reward by following his
instructions, and that he, himself, might secure
the $5,000 reward by pointing out the whereabouts
of the men.</p>

<p>But he instantly banished the thought of helping
the brutal officer get a cent of the money. He
would rather take the chance of letting the men get
away and losing his own share of the money offered
for their arrest and conviction.</p>

<p>Things looked pretty dark for the boys just then.
If arrested and locked up, the <i>Rambler</i> would be
at the mercy of the lawless men who frequented the
river there. Without doubt, all the stores would be
stolen. Even the boat itself might be taken. It
looked like the end of their long-planned journey
down the Columbia river.</p>

<p>As the boy walked briskly toward the boat,
accompanied by the two men, he saw a man in uniform
beckoning to the officer, who pretended not to see
him. However, he said to the surgeon, in a tone of
great vexation which Clay did not fail to note:
“There’s Sergeant Wilcox! If he gets his eyes on
the boy before I do, he will claim the reward. He
is too soft to carry this thing through, anyway.
He’ll let the boys talk him out of the money. We’d
better make haste to the boat. If Wilcox wasn’t my
superior officer, I’d take a crack at his head with
a billy. He’s always butting in!”</p>

<p>Clay had heard enough to convince him that Sergeant
Wilcox was the man he wanted to talk with! Should
he prove considerate and reasonable, he should
receive the information which would be worth
$10,000 to him—the information which a little
decency on the part of DeYoung might have won for
him!</p>

<p>When the policeman and the surgeon started
toward the boat at a pace calculated to get them there
before Sergeant Wilcox could overtake them, Clay
hung back and DeYoung seized him by the arm to
hurry him along. The boy drew away and ran toward
the Sergeant, who advanced to meet him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter here?” the Sergeant asked, not
unkindly.</p>

<p>“This officer has arrested me, and threatens to
arrest my chums,” Clay explained, “and I want you
to hear my story.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my boy,” replied the Sergeant “You
don’t look like a very hardened criminal,” he
added, as DeYoung approached with a pair of
handcuffs dangling in his hands, “so I guess we
won’t have you ironed.”</p>

<p>“This boy and his chums,” stormed DeYoung, “are
connected with the train robbers, and I have
arrested them all as such. I’m now going to the
boat you see down there to take them all to jail.”</p>

<p>“One of the boys has a broken leg,” pleaded Clay,
“and ought not to be moved. And everything we have
will be stolen if we are taken away from our boat
and locked up.”</p>

<p>“It won’t injure the boy to be moved.” the surgeon
cut in, “and I’ll see that their property is not
molested. We, DeYoung and I, think we have that
reward cinched!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you do!” cried Clay, with flashing eyes.
“You’d ruin us boys in the hope of getting it,
too!”</p>

<p>“The injured lad shall not be moved, nor shall he
lock you up until we have plenty of proof,” said
the Sergeant.</p>

<p>“You’re a gentleman!” Clay burst out, tears of
gratitude showing in his eyes “You’re a gentleman,
and I’m going to tell you where to find the
robbers! I should have told this other officer if
he had acted half-way decent. I think I know where
the men you want are, at least, and you can get
them in a short time, too.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me?” almost shrieked DeYoung.
“You ought to have told me. I was the first officer
you met. It was your duty to have told the first
officer you met!”</p>

<p>“Because you’re a brute,” answered Clay, secure in
the protection of the Sergeant. “If you’ll send him
away, Sergeant,” the boy added, “I’ll take you to
the boat and tell you the whole story. But perhaps
you’d better get your men together, all ready to go
after the robbers.”</p>

<p>“It is a plant!” cried DeYoung. “He wants to send
us away so the robbers can raid the town. Don’t you
believe a word he says!”</p>

<p>“Go back to the station, DeYoung,” the Sergeant
ordered. “When I want any advice from you I’ll ask
for it. And we can get along without your company,
too, doctor,” he added.</p>

<p>“But we claim the reward!” said the surgeon,
angrily. “You can’t come here with your high and
mighty ways and insult me. I’m not under your
authority! We claim the reward!”</p>

<p>“Get out!” replied the Sergeant. “Come, young man,
we’ll go to this boat you are all talking about,
and you can tell me the story or not, just as you
please. I’m working to do my duty, not expressly to
win rewards. DeYoung sees nothing but the reward,
though he is a fairly efficient policeman. I’ll
have to transfer him into the woods farther!” On
the way to the boat Clay told the whole story,
omitting nothing. He even told of their suspicions
of Gran and his strange disappearance, and of the
three men seen on the mountain, and where they
might be found, provided they had not moved on,
which the boy considered doubtful.</p>

<p>“I understand the boy’s part in the game,” the
officer said, “and think you have the robbers
located, all right. And now about this other
man—the fellow with the long arms. I think I have a
line on him,” with a queer smile. “I’ll show you
some dispatches presently which concern him.”</p>

<p>Clay opened his eyes in amazement.</p>

<p>“Is he one of the robbers?” he asked.</p>

<p>The Sergeant laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“I think I have a surprise for you,” he said. “You
just wait a few hours. You don’t know that I came
here to meet this boat, do you?”</p>

<p>“Why, how did you know? What is the mystery? We’ve
been clouded in mystery ever since we left the
mountain pass.”</p>

<p>“You’ll soon be out of it,” replied the Sergeant.
“You’ll have a clear field to start another puzzle
column in,” he laughed.</p>

<p>“No more puzzle columns for me!” declared Clay.
“But how did you know about the boat coming here?”</p>

<p>“Why,” laughed the officer, “I even know the names
of your chums! Second sight, eh! I know where you
started from, and all about it. I’ve been waiting
for you two days!”</p>

<p>“I give it up!” said Clay, and not another word
would he say until the boat was reached and a
general consultation was held. Gran smiled when the
Sergeant was introduced to him and said:</p>

<p>“We have been waiting a long time for you, Sergeant
Wilcox!”</p>

<p>“Now, what do you think of that?” asked Case. “I
don’t think any more!” laughed Clay. “I’m beyond
being astonished at anything.”</p>

<p>“Is Gran under arrest?” asked Alex.</p>

<p>The Sergeant shook his head and held up a hand for
silence.</p>

<p>“It is only a train from the east,” Clay
volunteered.</p>

<p>“Is that our train?” asked Gran, looking up into
the Sergeant’s face with a confiding smile. “Is
that OUR train?”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” replied the officer. “And now, Mr.
Clay,” he added, “you come with me to the station,
and you may learn of something to your advantage,
as the newspaper advertisements say. The others
will remain here for the present.”</p>

<p>“We’re too paralyzed to make a movement,” suggested
Alex.</p>

<p>Captain Joe arose to follow Clay and Teddy shambled
up to the officer and tried to climb up the
official stripe on the seam of his trousers. The
Sergeant laughed and patted the bear on the head.</p>

<p>“You’re a happy family!” he said. “Come on, Clay.”</p>

<p>Gran waved a thin hand at the two departing ones
and turned to Alex.</p>

<p>“You’re going to hear the end of the story
directly,” he said. “I’m not going to tell it,
though.”</p>

<p>“Who is?” demanded Case. “We’ve been trying to tell
it to each other ever since you came on the
<i>Rambler</i> that night at the pass, and have made up
our minds that we don’t know it!”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” Gran said, and closed his eyes,
leaving Alex and Case half crazy with curiosity!</p>

<p>When the train drew up, the first man to leave the
parlor coach made a rush for the Sergeant and shook
him warmly by the hand. This done he looked Clay
over with a curious smile on a face recently shaved
clean.</p>

<p>The man was at least six foot three, and had very
long arms. Also a slight limp! Clay sat down on a
trunk and waited.</p>
 </div>

 <div class='chapter'>
 <h2 id='chXXIV'>CHAPTER XXIV.—MORE SURPRISES THAN ONE.</h2>

<p>“This,” the boy heard Sergeant Wilcox saying,
directly, “is Mr. Richard Miller, of Chicago. And
this, Mr. Miller, is Mr. Clayton Emmett, also known
as ‘Clay,’ recently from Chicago!”</p>

<p>Clay heard the words dimly. The world seemed
turning around upside down. Here was the man he had
been accusing of all sorts of crime, from simple
larceny to murder, on good terms with the chief, in
that district, of the mounted police! It was enough
to turn the lad’s head.</p>

<p>“I thought—”</p>

<p>Then Clay decided not to say what he had been
thinking, and the three set out for the boat,
passing DeYoung and the surgeon on the way. They
both regarded the officer with scowls and
threatening gestures.</p>

<p>At the boat the boy lifted on his bunk when Mr.
Miller approached and extended his arms. The man
dropped down at his side.</p>

<p>“Daddy! Daddy!” they hear Gran saying.</p>

<p>“I’m going out somewhere and have another dream!”
Alex said. “I’m afraid I’ll never wake up out of
this one. That is the man who stole our boat and
the man who cut our anchor chain!”</p>

<p>“Not exactly!” said Miller. “I’m going to tell you
about that, after I return something I have of
yours.”</p>

<p>He reached into a pocket and brought forth a packet
of films and developed pictures. The pictures
showed campfire scenes, and back of the faces
before the blaze was the face of a tall man,
looking out in wonder.</p>

<p>“Where did you get them developed?” asked Alex.
“Where did you get them, anyway? We always thought
Gran took them.”</p>

<p>“I did,” admitted the boy, with a smile, “and gave
them to Daddy, and he had them developed at Donald
and sent copies to the police at Chicago. See that
face back of the others? That’s Daddy.”</p>

<p>“Then he’s one of the train robbers!” declared
Case.</p>

<p>“But he was with them, and the officers have his
description, as well as that of Gran,” Alex
insisted when the officer shook his head.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was with them,” the Sergeant said, “and so
was Gran, up to that night. They did not know what
the three men were there for, and when they
discovered that they were there to rob a train they
left them, the boy making friends with you
boys and going on the <i>Rambler</i>, and the father getting on
the train and being chased off.”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t they both come to us and tell us?”
asked Clay. “We would have taken them both in.”</p>

<p>“But there was a charge of murder against Mr.
Miller,” replied the officer, “and he did not know,
you boys so well then as he has learned to know you
since that night. He couldn’t make up his mind to
trust you.”</p>

<p>“We know what the charge is,” Alex said. “We found
the newspaper which the robbers left in their
camp.”</p>

<p>“Richard Miller was in Wells street the night
Stiven was shot,” the Sergeant went on, “but he did
not do the shooting. That was done by Blinn, Carr,
and Snow, the three men you saw in the hills, the
three men who held up the train.</p>

<p>“When the shots which killed Stiven were fired, Mr.
Miller got out of the way, naturally. He saw the
faces of the three men, and started to the Chicago
avenue police station to inform the officers as to
their identity. On the way there he heard a
conversation between officers which informed him
that he was suspected, and that the three men were
to testify against him.</p>

<p>“All he could do, under the circumstances, was to
hide, unless he wanted to be held without bail
pending trial. He made it his business that night,
with the aid of a Pinkerton man, to locate the
three murderers, and from that day on he followed
them, hoping that in some way they would finally
betray the truth.</p>

<p>“He followed them to many cities, and finally, when
they came to the Rocky mountains he sent for his
son, Gran, to join him. Together they joined the
robbers and sought information which would clear
the father of the crime.</p>

<p>“The chance to prove his innocence never came to
the father until the night these pictures were
taken. They located the robbers on the ground where
the robbery took place. When he left them that
night, after Gran had gone to the <i>Rambler</i>, he
knew that the train was to be held up, as a
previous attempt had been made on the freight.</p>

<p>“He knew, too, that the pictures taken by Alex
would prove sufficient to convict them, as their
portraits are in the rogue’s gallery at Chicago. He
tried to warn the conductor of the train that took
the boat away that a hold-up was in the air, but
the conductor wouldn’t listen, and caused him to be
chased from the train—as he thought.</p>

<p>“However, Mr. Miller rode on the train, wounded by
the bullet, to Donald, saw Gran there for a minute,
and arranged to have the films taken so that he
might have them developed. It was also arranged
that he was to purchase a rowboat and follow the
<i>Rambler</i> until the films were delivered to him.
Then he was to go away and have them developed.</p>

<p>“Father and son had many meetings which you never
knew about, and when, at last, the films were
delivered to the father, he was afraid to go out
with them, as the officers were looking for him on
advices from Chicago. So he took Gran away with
him, and, after the pictures had been made and
Chicago communicated with, the boy returned over
the mountains, though his father tried to get him
to wait and meet you here.</p>

<p>“Then I came into the game. Mr. Miller came to me
here with the story and the pictures. He also told
me where the boat was and how soon it would be
here. Then he went up to Calgary to shave and dress
up like a gentleman.</p>

<p>“But he did not know that the robbers had followed
you boys into the mountains in the hope of getting
the boat, of capturing Gran, and closing his lips
forever, for they had suspicions that he had gone
out to betray them. They cut the anchor chain,
hoping that you would all be drowned in the rapids.
But it was Mr. Miller who caught the rowboat and
used it until he left for this point. It was
wrecked after he left it. Anything else?” asked the
Sergeant, as he concluded.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they tell us all about it?” asked Case.
“What was the use of being so sly about it?”</p>

<p>“If they had understood you all then as well as
they do now,” the officer replied, “they would
doubtless have done so.”</p>

<p>“Why did he chase me when I was getting away with
the pictures?” asked Alex pointing to Mr. Miller.</p>

<p>“Because I wanted the films,” laughed the other,
“and I got them, in time, as you all know!”</p>

<p>“I wonder why the robbers didn’t kill us while we
slept, if they wanted us out of the way, instead of
cutting the anchor chain,” Case puzzled. “I should
think they would have made a sure thing of it.”</p>

<p>“I wondered at that,” the Sergeant said, “but I
think now that they were afraid that the murder
would be discovered and that they would be
suspected. Anyway such a crime as that, when the
river gave up the bodies, would have filled this
district with police officers, and they would have
made it very uncomfortable for the robbers. They
doubtless thought, too, that the rapids would do
the work satisfactorily.”</p>

<p>“And the robbers built the signal fire?” asked
Clay.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the officer. “At least that is what
Mr. Miller thinks. They must have separated, and
wanted to get together again.”</p>

<p>“When are you going out after them?” asked Clay.</p>

<p>“I have a company of men forming now,” was the
reply. “You boys remain here a few days and you’ll
see them brought in. Of course the boys who saw
them in the mountains and reported it will get the
$5,000 reward offered for locating the robbers.
That will help some, eh?” he added, with a smile.</p>

<p>“We can get along without it,” Gran broke in. “I
guess Daddy has enough money for us all. He’s spent
$10,000 on this man-hunt, but he had to do it, or
forever live under the suspicion that he killed the
man Stiven and bought himself clear. The only thing
for him to do was to follow the murderers and keep
with them until he knew that he could convict them.
They will never confess. We can introduce in the
trial THE CONFESSION OF A PHOTOGRAPH!”</p>

<p>There were many little details which the boys had
wondered over set to rights that day, and father
and son told many amusing stories of their trip out
with the films. Until they had confided the whole
story to the Sergeant, they were in danger of
arrest.</p>

<p>The Sergeant went out with a dozen men that night,
and in two days was back with the prisoners, who
confessed to the robbery as soon as they saw their
pictures in the group by the campfire. Their “mugs”
were already well known to the police, and they
knew that the pictures showing them on the
scene of the robbery just before it took place would be
sufficient to convict them.</p>

<p>“You will have no trouble in getting the $5,000
reward,” the Sergeant said to the boys, as they
were getting ready to move on down the Columbia
river. “By the time you reach Portland it will be
waiting for you.”</p>

<p>It may be as well to state that the money was
awaiting them at Portland, and that they at once
planned another trip, this one to the Colorado
river.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller went back to Chicago with the robbers,
and Gran, although his leg was still useless,
decided to go on with the boys. The father was to
meet them in Portland later. He was a very rich
man. Gran always declared that only for that he
would have been hanged for the murder of Stiven!</p>

<p>There was sincere regret at parting with Sergeant
Wilcox, for he had greatly assisted in
straightening Out the tangle. He promised to meet
the boys later on, but under what strange
circumstances they were to meet again they had no
premonition at that time!</p>

<p>And so, once more, the boys were afloat on the
Columbia! With minds free from mystery and
financial worry, they spent the long summer, up to
the first of September, making their way to the
Pacific.</p>

<p>There were hard days and night, for the river is
rough and wild in many places, but there were also
sunny days when the <i>Rambler</i> glided over the water
like a duck in a fountain pond!</p>

<p>And Captain Joe and Teddy, the bear, enjoyed the
trip as much as the boys did. When there were
campfires on the shore at night the two had many a
run in the forest. And Teddy always returned, to
sleep with his soft little nose against the dog’s
hairy shoulder!</p>

<p>Alex caught fish. Case made bread, and Clay hunted
up the history of the country they were passing
through and read it to them in the cabin after the
amusement-filled days were over. It was in every
way an ideal trip—a summer trip over one of the
grandest rivers in the world.</p>

<p>“I hope,” Clay said, one night in Portland, after
it was all over, “that we shall have as much fun on
the Colorado.”</p>

<p>“It was pretty serious sometimes on the Columbia,”
Gran said.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but we enjoyed it, except the time a bear
wanted me to come out of my tree!” laughed Alex.
“The Colorado offers chances for just as much
excitement. Don’t you ever think we are going to a
pink tea party when we sail down the Colorado,
through the canyons and over the rapids.”</p>

<p>Whether or not the trip down the Colorado was a “pink tea
party” will be told in the next volume of this
series: “The Motor Boat Boys on the Colorado; or,
the Clue in the Rocks.”</p>

<p>And Captain Joe and Teddy? They were as happy at
the finish of the Columbia river trip as the
others, and as ready to go over to the Colorado and
do it all over again!</p>
